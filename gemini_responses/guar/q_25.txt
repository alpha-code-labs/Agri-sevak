As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Guar (Cluster Bean) in Haryana:

Guar is generally considered a drought-tolerant crop, well-suited to the semi-arid conditions of Haryana. However, timely and judicious irrigation, especially during critical growth stages, can significantly enhance yield and quality.

*   **General Irrigation Principles for Guar:**
    *   Guar is sensitive to waterlogging, so ensure proper drainage.
    *   The most critical stages for water application are flowering and pod development.
    *   The total number of irrigations depends heavily on the monsoon rainfall pattern and soil type.

*   **First Irrigation:**
    *   **Pre-sowing Irrigation:** If there is insufficient soil moisture at the time of sowing (e.g., delayed monsoon or dry spell), a light pre-sowing irrigation can be beneficial for uniform germination.
    *   **Post-sowing Irrigation:** If monsoon rains are delayed or insufficient after germination, the first irrigation should be applied at the **pre-flowering to early flowering stage**, typically around **30-40 days after sowing (DAS)**. This is a crucial stage for flower initiation and subsequent pod setting. Avoid heavy irrigation that could lead to waterlogging.

*   **Second Irrigation (and Subsequent):**
    *   A second irrigation is highly beneficial if there is a prolonged dry spell after the first irrigation, particularly during the **pod development and filling stage**. This usually falls around **60-75 days after sowing (DAS)**.
    *   In most cases, with adequate monsoon rainfall, 1-2 irrigations (in addition to rainfall) are sufficient for Guar in Haryana. In severe drought conditions, a third light irrigation might be considered during late pod development, but this is less common. Always assess the soil moisture status before applying water.

*   **Sprinkler Use:**
    *   Sprinkler irrigation is highly recommended and efficient for Guar cultivation in Haryana, especially in areas with lighter soils (sandy to sandy loam) where water retention is lower.
    *   **Advantages of Sprinkler Irrigation for Guar:**
        *   **High Water Use Efficiency:** Minimizes water loss through deep percolation and surface runoff, ensuring water reaches the root zone effectively.
        *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Provides even moisture across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
        *   **Prevents Waterlogging:** Allows for light and frequent irrigations, which Guar prefers, without causing waterlogging that can harm the crop.
        *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be used effectively on uneven land where flood irrigation is difficult or inefficient.
        *   **Conservation of Water:** Significantly reduces the total water requirement compared to traditional flood irrigation, which is crucial in water-scarce regions of Haryana.
