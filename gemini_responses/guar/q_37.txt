Wild animals, such as Nilgai (Blue Bull), wild boar, and monkeys, can cause significant damage to Guar crops in Haryana. Effective protection primarily relies on physical barriers and deterrents. Chemical repellents specifically approved by CIBRC for wild animal control on Guar crops are not commonly available or recommended for large-scale field application in India. Therefore, the focus is on integrated, non-chemical management strategies:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:** This is the most effective method to prevent entry.
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** Construct a multi-strand barbed wire fence (at least 5-7 strands) around the field. The height should be sufficient to deter Nilgai (typically 1.5-2 meters).
        *   **Electric Fencing:** Install a solar-powered, low-voltage electric fence. These fences deliver a non-lethal shock that deters animals without causing harm. Ensure proper earthing and regular maintenance. Local regulations and safety precautions must be strictly followed.
        *   **Mesh Fencing:** For areas with significant monkey or smaller animal problems, a strong mesh fence can be considered, though it is more expensive.
*   **Scaring Devices and Human Presence:**
    *   **Acoustic Deterrents:** Use sound-based deterrents like gas guns (with necessary permissions), firecrackers (used judiciously), or loud noise-making devices to scare animals away, especially during vulnerable crop stages.
    *   **Visual Deterrents:** Employ scarecrows, reflective ribbons, flashing lights, or dummy predators. Their effectiveness is often temporary as animals can habituate to them.
    *   **Watchmen/Guard Dogs:** Employing watchmen or trained guard dogs can be highly effective in deterring animals through constant presence and vigilance.
*   **Habitat Management:**
    *   **Clearance of Hiding Spots:** Remove bushes, tall weeds, and other vegetation around the field boundaries that provide cover or shelter for wild animals.
    *   **Avoid Attractants:** Ensure no food waste or other attractants are left near the fields that might draw animals.
*   **Community-Based Approach:**
    *   **Coordinated Efforts:** Collaborate with neighboring farmers to implement protection measures collectively. A synchronized approach across a larger area is often more effective than individual efforts.
