As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Guar (cluster bean) based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana.

**Crucial First Step: Soil Testing**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is paramount to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This provides an accurate assessment of nutrient availability in your specific field, allowing for precise and efficient fertilizer application, preventing both deficiencies and wasteful excesses.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency in Guar

Guar is a leguminous crop and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in its root nodules. Therefore, its nitrogen requirement is generally lower than non-leguminous crops. Excessive nitrogen application can inhibit nodulation.

*   **Role of Nitrogen:** Essential for vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation, and overall plant vigor.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** General yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, and reduced branching.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Basal Application:** A starter dose of nitrogen is often recommended to support initial growth before effective nodulation is established.
        *   Apply 15-20 kg Nitrogen per acre as a basal dose. This is often supplied through **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** or a small amount of **Urea** along with other basal fertilizers.
    *   **Foliar Application (if severe deficiency observed post-emergence and poor nodulation):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1% solution of **Urea** (5-10 g of **Urea** per liter of water).
        *   Apply during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening).
        *   Repeat if necessary after 7-10 days, ensuring good nodulation is encouraged through proper inoculation and soil conditions.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency in Guar

Phosphorus is a critical nutrient for Guar, especially for root development, nodulation, flowering, and seed formation.

*   **Role of Phosphorus:** Promotes strong root growth, enhances nodulation, improves flowering and fruiting, and aids in energy transfer within the plant.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (less common in Guar than other crops), delayed maturity, and poor seed set.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Phosphorus is best applied as a basal dose, as it is relatively immobile in the soil.
        *   Apply 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre as a basal dose.
        *   Recommended sources:
            *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): Adjust N application if using DAP.
            *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): Also provides sulfur, which is beneficial for legumes.
    *   **Foliar Application (if severe deficiency observed post-emergence):**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Mono-ammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (10-20 g of **MAP** per liter of water).
        *   Apply during cooler parts of the day.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency in Guar

Potassium plays a vital role in various physiological processes, including water regulation, nutrient transport, and disease resistance.

*   **Role of Potassium:** Enhances drought tolerance, improves disease resistance, strengthens stems (reducing lodging), and improves seed quality and yield.
*   **Deficiency Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning of leaf margins (scorching) on older leaves, stunted growth, weak stems, and reduced seed size.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Basal Application:** Apply potassium as a basal dose, especially on light-textured soils or where soil tests indicate low potassium levels.
        *   Apply 20-30 kg K2O per acre as a basal dose.
        *   Recommended source:
            *   **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O).
    *   **Foliar Application (if severe deficiency observed post-emergence):**
        *   Spray 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per liter of water) or **Potassium Sulphate** (10-20 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per liter of water).
        *   Apply during cooler parts of the day.

**General Advice:**
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) and bio-fertilizers (Rhizobium inoculants for Guar) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate nutrient deficiency symptoms and reduce nutrient uptake efficiency.
*   **Timely Application:** Apply fertilizers at the correct growth stages for maximum benefit.
