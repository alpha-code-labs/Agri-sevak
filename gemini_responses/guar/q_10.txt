As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Guar (Cluster Bean) in Haryana:

**1. Control of Borers, Caterpillars, and Leaf folder in Guar:**

These pests, primarily belonging to the Lepidoptera order, can cause significant damage to Guar by feeding on leaves, stems, flowers, and pods. Early detection and timely intervention are crucial.

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially during flowering and pod formation stages, to detect the presence of larvae and assess the extent of damage.
    *   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain field hygiene, remove weeds that can act as alternate hosts, and practice proper crop rotation.
    *   **Biological Control:** Conserve natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory bugs. Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.
    *   **Pheromone Traps:** Install pheromone traps for major pod borers (e.g., *Helicoverpa armigera*) at 5 traps per acre for monitoring pest population.

*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence reaches Economic Threshold Level - ETL):**
    When pest populations exceed the ETL, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always ensure thorough spray coverage.

    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply 60 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply 200-220 g per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply 200 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre in 200-250 litres of water. (Note: This is a broad-spectrum insecticide; use judiciously to preserve beneficial insects).

    **Important Note:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

**2. Diamondback Moth (DBM) in Guar:**

This is not known to affect Guar. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**General Precautions:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the pesticide label before harvesting.
