As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Guar:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation in Guar. Integrated pest management strategies are recommended, including cultural practices like field sanitation and deep ploughing to expose eggs, followed by chemical control if infestation levels are high.

For chemical control, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply 1.25 L per acre mixed in 500 L of water.
*   **Quinalphos 25% EC**: Apply 500 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply 100-120 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.

Ensure thorough coverage of the crop during spraying. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Guar. Painted bug (*Bagrada hilaris*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard.

### Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Guar. Red cotton bug (*Dysdercus koenigii*) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### Black ants

This is not known to affect Guar as a direct pest causing significant damage. Black ants are often secondary, attracted to honeydew secreted by other sucking pests (e.g., aphids, mealybugs) that might be present on the Guar plants. If black ants are observed, it is advisable to inspect the plants for primary sucking pests. Control should focus on managing the primary sucking pest if present, which will indirectly reduce the ant population.
