As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and plant growth stimulants for Guar cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific verification:

It is crucial to incorporate organic manures into the soil well before sowing to allow for proper decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Farm Yard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **5-10 tonnes per acre** (approximately 12.5-25 tonnes per hectare).
    *   Incorporate into the soil 2-3 weeks before sowing. The exact dose can be adjusted based on soil organic carbon content and previous crop residue management.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **1-2 tonnes per acre** (approximately 2.5-5 tonnes per hectare).
    *   Incorporate into the soil 1-2 weeks before sowing. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, hence a lower dose is sufficient.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based Plant Growth Stimulant):**
    *   Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based plant growth stimulant and not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It is primarily used for seed treatment or foliar application to enhance germination, root development, and overall plant vigour.
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   Mix **100 ml of Sagarika liquid per 10-15 kg of Guar seeds**.
        *   Treat seeds just before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   First spray: Apply **250-500 ml of Sagarika liquid per acre** (mixed in 150-200 litres of water) at 30-40 days after sowing (DAS).
        *   Second spray (if needed): Apply **250-500 ml of Sagarika liquid per acre** (mixed in 150-200 litres of water) at flowering stage.
