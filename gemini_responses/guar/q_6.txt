As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Guar (Cluster Bean) in Haryana.

Firstly, regarding the specific viruses mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Guar. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

For the other viral diseases such as Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus, these are significant concerns in Guar cultivation. It is important to understand that there is no direct chemical control for viral diseases themselves. The primary strategy involves managing the insect vectors that transmit these viruses and implementing robust cultural practices.

The main vectors for viral diseases in Guar are typically whiteflies and sometimes aphids or thrips.

### **Integrated Management Strategies for Viral Diseases in Guar:**

**A. Cultural Control Measures:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, plant Guar varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases prevalent in Haryana, such as Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) or Guar Leaf Curl Virus (GLCV). Consult HAU recommendations for suitable varieties.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Sow Guar at the recommended time to avoid peak vector populations, which can vary by region and season.
3.  **Weed Management:** Keep the field and surrounding areas free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for both the viruses and their insect vectors.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle.
5.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plants promptly to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
6.  **Vector Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the field for the presence of insect vectors (whiteflies, aphids) using yellow sticky traps or visual inspection. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention.
7.  **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.

**B. Chemical Control Measures (for Vector Management):**

The goal of chemical control is to reduce the vector population, thereby minimizing virus transmission. Always follow label instructions and safety precautions.

1.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic insecticide before sowing to provide early protection against sucking pests.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 5-7 ml per kg seed.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 30% FS @ 3-4 ml per kg seed.

2.  **Foliar Sprays (for Whiteflies and Aphids):**
    *   Apply foliar sprays upon observing vector populations exceeding economic threshold levels or at early stages of infestation. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    *   **For Whiteflies:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 125-150 ml per acre.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 100 g per acre.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 100-125 g per acre.
        *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC @ 500-600 ml per acre (effective against nymphs).
        *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC @ 200-250 ml per acre.

    *   **For Aphids:**
        *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 125-150 ml per acre.
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 100 g per acre.
        *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP @ 100-125 g per acre.
        *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG @ 60 g per acre.
        *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC @ 660 ml per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use the recommended dosage and ensure thorough spray coverage.
*   Adhere to the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the insecticide label.
*   Consult with your local HAU extension specialist for the most current recommendations and specific product availability in your area.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is the most sustainable and effective strategy for managing viral diseases in Guar.
