As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Wilt (including Parawilt) in Guar in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand that "Wilt" and "Parawilt" are distinct conditions requiring different management strategies.

### 1. Control of Wilt (Fusarium Wilt) in Guar

Wilt in Guar is primarily caused by the soil-borne fungus *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cyamopsidis*. Management focuses on an integrated approach.

**A. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective long-term solution is to cultivate wilt-resistant or tolerant varieties. HAU recommends varieties such as HG 365, HG 563, HG 870, HG 2-20, RGC 1066, RGC 1038, and RGC 1017, which show varying degrees of resistance.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice a long crop rotation (at least 2-3 years) with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, pearl millet) to reduce the pathogen load in the soil.
*   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Expose the soil to high summer temperatures by deep ploughing, which helps in reducing the inoculum of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible. Ensure adequate phosphorus and potassium, as they contribute to plant vigor and disease resistance.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow guar at the recommended time to avoid periods of high disease pressure.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent the build-up and spread of inoculum.

**B. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-fungicides before sowing.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: 4-5 g/kg seed.

**C. Chemical Control (Seed Treatment):**

*   Seed treatment with CIBRC approved fungicides is highly effective in protecting seedlings from early infection.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS: 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: 2 g/kg seed.

### 2. Control of Parawilt in Guar

Parawilt is a physiological disorder, not a disease caused by a pathogen. It is often triggered by sudden environmental stresses, particularly related to water and temperature fluctuations. There are no chemical controls for Parawilt.

**A. Water Management:**

*   **Avoid Sudden Irrigation:** Do not apply heavy irrigation immediately after a prolonged dry spell, especially during high temperatures. This sudden change in soil moisture can shock the plants.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure fields have good drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can also induce parawilt symptoms.
*   **Light and Frequent Irrigation:** If irrigation is necessary during hot periods, provide light and frequent irrigations rather than heavy, infrequent ones, to maintain consistent soil moisture.

**B. Soil and Nutrient Management:**

*   **Improve Soil Structure:** Enhance soil aeration and drainage by incorporating organic matter and practicing appropriate tillage.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Ensure a balanced supply of essential nutrients. Potassium plays a role in plant stress tolerance and can help mitigate parawilt.

**C. Heat Stress Mitigation:**

*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch can help regulate soil temperature and conserve moisture, reducing stress on plants.
*   **Variety Selection:** While there are no specific "Parawilt resistant" varieties, selecting varieties that are generally more robust and tolerant to environmental stresses can be beneficial.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, farmers can effectively control both Fusarium Wilt and Parawilt in Guar, ensuring healthier crops and better yields.
