As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Guar (Cluster Bean) in Haryana:

### Control of Scab in Guar

Scab in Guar is caused by the fungus *Elsinoe iwatae* (also known as *Sphaceloma iwatae*). It manifests as small, raised, corky lesions on leaves, stems, and pods.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops.
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest.

2.  **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   For preventive or early-stage infection, spray with:
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
    *   For curative action on established infections, spray with:
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 500 g/acre (or 1 g/L water).

### Control of Canker in Guar

While a specific "canker" disease like those found in woody plants is not typically described for Guar, bacterial blight (*Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. cyamopsidis*) can cause stem lesions and canker-like symptoms.

**Control Measures (for Bacterial Blight/Stem Lesions):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use certified disease-free seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, which can spread bacteria.

2.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with a combination bactericide:
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP at 100 g per 100 kg of seed.

3.  **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   For existing infections, spray with:
        *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
        *   **Streptomycin sulphate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP at 100 g in 200 L water per acre (0.5 g/L water).

### Control of Gummosis in Guar

This is not known to affect Guar as a specific disease. Gummosis is primarily a condition affecting woody perennial plants (trees and shrubs) in response to stress, injury, or specific pathogens, leading to the exudation of gum. Guar is an annual herbaceous plant and does not typically exhibit gummosis.

### Control of Lichen in Guar

This is not known to affect Guar. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not cause disease or damage to plants. They are not known to grow on annual herbaceous plants like Guar.
