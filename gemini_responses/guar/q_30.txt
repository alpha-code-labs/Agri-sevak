As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) in Haryana:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to accurately diagnose nutrient deficiencies and avoid imbalances.

### 1. Slow Growth

**Causes:**
*   **Nutrient Deficiency:** Lack of essential nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, or micronutrients (e.g., Zinc, Iron).
*   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient and excessive moisture can hinder growth.
*   **Soil Compaction/Poor Aeration:** Restricts root development.
*   **Low Soil Organic Matter:** Reduces nutrient availability and water retention.
*   **Weed Competition:** Weeds compete for nutrients, water, and light.
*   **Suboptimal Temperatures:** Guar prefers warm conditions for optimal growth.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies.
*   **Nutrient Management (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing if required, especially in sandy soils or where initial N was low.
    *   **Phosphorus (P) Deficiency:** Apply **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) at sowing, as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) at sowing, as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10 kg/acre as a basal application, or a foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal soil moisture. Provide light and timely irrigation during dry spells. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Soil Improvement:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 tonnes/acre) to improve soil structure and organic matter content.
*   **Weed Control:** Implement timely weeding (manual or chemical) to reduce competition.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

**Causes:**
*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** General yellowing, starting from older leaves.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, common in high pH soils.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Stunted growth, yellowing, sometimes with a purplish tinge.
*   **Waterlogging:** Impairs root function and nutrient uptake, leading to general yellowing.

**Management:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Essential to pinpoint the specific nutrient deficiency.
*   **Nutrient Application (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Apply **Urea** (46% N) at 20-30 kg/acre as a top dressing.
    *   **Iron Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution, 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
*   **Drainage Improvement:** Ensure proper field drainage to prevent waterlogging.

### 3. Excessive Height

**Causes:**
*   **High Nitrogen Application:** Promotes excessive vegetative growth, leading to taller plants.
*   **Dense Planting:** Competition for light in crowded conditions can lead to etiolation (stretching for light).
*   **Variety Specific:** Some Guar varieties are naturally taller.

**Management:**
*   **Optimize Nitrogen Application:** Apply Nitrogen strictly as per soil test recommendations. Guar, being a legume, has lower N requirements due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Avoid excessive N fertilization.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant-to-plant and row-to-row spacing (e.g., 30-45 cm row-to-row, 10-15 cm plant-to-plant) to ensure adequate light penetration and air circulation.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose semi-dwarf or lodging-resistant Guar varieties if excessive height and lodging are recurring problems in your area.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** Plant growth regulators are generally not recommended or CIBRC approved for height control in Guar in India, as cultural practices are usually sufficient.

### 4. Excessive Flowering (Premature or Abnormal)

**Causes:**
*   **Stress (Drought/Heat):** Environmental stresses can induce premature or profuse flowering as a survival mechanism, often leading to poor pod set or flower drop.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance:** While not always "excessive," imbalances can lead to poor quality flowers or reduced pod development.
*   **Variety Specific:** Some varieties may have different flowering patterns.

**Management:**
*   **Optimal Water Management:** Provide timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical stages like flowering and pod development, to mitigate drought stress.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced supply of all essential nutrients, particularly Phosphorus and Potassium, which are crucial for flowering and fruiting.
    *   Foliar application of **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 0% P, 45% K2O) at 1% (10 g/L) solution can sometimes help improve flower retention and pod setting under stress conditions, but ensure it's part of a balanced nutrient program based on soil tests.
*   **Stress Mitigation:** Protect plants from extreme heat if possible through proper irrigation and maintaining plant vigor.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose Guar varieties known for stable flowering and good pod set under local agro-climatic conditions.
