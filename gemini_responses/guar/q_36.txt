As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for Guar (cluster bean) in Haryana:

### Improving Yield for Guar

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. HAU-released varieties such as HG 365, HG 563, HG 870, and HG 2-20 are recommended.

2.  **Optimal Sowing Time:**
    *   Sow during the optimal window of mid-July to mid-August for the Kharif season to ensure good establishment and growth.

3.  **Seed Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds before sowing to protect against early diseases and pests, and to enhance nutrient uptake:
        *   **Fungicide:** Treat with **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) + **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed) or **Tebuconazole** (1.25 ml/kg seed).
        *   **Insecticide:** For protection against early sucking pests, treat with **Imidacloprid** (5-7 ml/kg seed).
        *   **Bio-fertilizers:** Inoculate seeds with *Rhizobium* culture (200 g/10-15 kg seed) and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB) culture (200 g/10-15 kg seed) to improve nitrogen fixation and phosphorus availability.

4.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply a starter dose of 15-20 kg N/acre.
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 40-60 kg P2O5/acre, as phosphorus is crucial for root development and pod formation.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 20 kg K2O/acre if soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Zinc (Zn):** Apply 5-10 kg **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21%) per acre at sowing, or a foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** if deficiency symptoms appear.
        *   **Iron (Fe):** If iron chlorosis appears, spray 0.5% **Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate** solution.
        *   **Boron (B):** A foliar spray of 0.1% **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at the flowering stage can improve pod setting and yield.

5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds effectively as they compete significantly for nutrients and moisture.
    *   Apply a pre-emergence herbicide like **Pendimethalin** (1.0-1.25 kg a.i./acre) or **Fluchloralin** (0.75-1.0 kg a.i./acre) within 1-3 days of sowing.

6.  **Water Management:**
    *   Guar is drought-tolerant, but one or two irrigations during critical stages (flowering and pod development) can significantly boost yield, especially during prolonged dry spells.

### Improving Fruit Quality for Guar

"Fruit quality" for Guar can refer to the tenderness and appearance of pods for vegetable use, or the gum content and overall seed quality for industrial use.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties specifically bred for desired quality traits, e.g., high gum content for industrial use or tender, less fibrous pods for vegetable consumption.

2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Balanced nutrition, particularly adequate phosphorus, potassium, and boron, is vital for good seed development and gum synthesis.
    *   A foliar spray of 0.1% **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at flowering can enhance seed filling and gum quality.

3.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   For vegetable use, harvest young, tender pods at the appropriate stage before they become fibrous.
    *   For seed production, harvest at physiological maturity when pods turn yellow and dry, ensuring maximum gum content and seed viability.

4.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Ensure uniform and thorough drying of pods/seeds after harvesting to prevent fungal growth and maintain quality.

### Improving Storage Life for Guar

1.  **Harvesting and Drying:**
    *   Harvest mature, dry pods. Thresh and clean seeds thoroughly.
    *   Reduce seed moisture content to below 10% for safe, long-term storage. High moisture content is the primary cause of spoilage.

2.  **Cleaning and Grading:**
    *   Remove all foreign matter, broken seeds, immature seeds, and plant debris. This reduces the inoculum for pests and diseases.

3.  **Storage Structure:**
    *   Store seeds in clean, dry, well-ventilated, rodent-proof, and insect-proof structures. Use new or thoroughly cleaned jute bags, or airtight containers.

4.  **Pest and Fungal Management in Storage:**
    *   **Fumigation (for large-scale storage):** If infestation is suspected or for long-term storage, fumigate with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets/tonne) for 5-7 days under airtight conditions. (Caution: This is a highly toxic chemical and must be handled by trained personnel following strict safety protocols).
    *   **Seed Treatment for Storage:**
        *   To protect against storage pests, mix seeds with **Malathion** dust (5% @ 250 g/100 kg seed) or **Deltamethrin** dust (2.5% @ 250 g/100 kg seed).
        *   For preventing fungal spoilage during long-term storage, treat seeds with **Carbendazim** (1 g/kg seed) or **Thiram** (2 g/kg seed).
    *   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically inspect stored seeds for signs of moisture accumulation, insect infestation, or fungal growth. Take immediate corrective action if any issues are detected.
