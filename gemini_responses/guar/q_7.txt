As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Guar:

**1. Dieback in Guar:**
This is not known to affect Guar as a specific, primary disease. While various stresses or severe infections (like Alternaria blight) can lead to symptoms resembling dieback, "Dieback" itself is not a commonly recognized disease name for Guar.

**2. Twig Blight in Guar:**
Twig blight in Guar is primarily caused by fungal pathogens such as *Alternaria cyamopsidis* (Alternaria blight) and *Colletotrichum capsici* (Anthracnose). Effective control involves integrated management practices:

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use disease-free certified seeds.
    *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years.
    *   Ensure proper field sanitation by removing and destroying infected plant debris after harvest.
    *   Avoid excessive irrigation and high humidity, which favor disease development.
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing to improve air circulation.

*   **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Initiate spraying at the first appearance of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity.
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP**: Apply 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 4-5 g/L of water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP**: Apply 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 3-4 g/L of water).
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC**: Apply 200-250 ml/acre (or 1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC**: Apply 200 ml/acre (or 1 ml/L of water).
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Apply 250-500 g/acre (or 0.5-1 g/L of water), particularly effective against Anthracnose.

**3. Tikka Disease in Guar:**
This is not known to affect Guar. Tikka disease is a common name for leaf spot diseases primarily affecting groundnut (peanut).
