As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Guar (Cluster Bean). This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods to ensure sustainable and effective pest management.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Guar.

For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips, please follow the recommendations below:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly scout your fields, especially the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, to detect pest infestations early. Look for sticky honeydew, sooty mould, distorted leaves, or the pests themselves.
2.  **Threshold Levels:** Initiate control measures when pest populations reach economic threshold levels (e.g., 5-10 aphids/leaf, 2-3 whiteflies/leaf, or significant leaf curling/yellowing).

**II. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Guar at the recommended time to avoid peak pest periods.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy weed hosts from around the field, as they can harbor pests.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogenous fertilizers, as they promote lush growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose Guar varieties known to have some tolerance or resistance to sucking pests.

**III. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphelinus* species for aphids, *Encarsia* species for whiteflies). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these natural enemies.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using biopesticides like entomopathogenic fungi (*Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii*) during early stages of infestation, especially under humid conditions.

**IV. Chemical Control (If necessary, follow these guidelines):**

When pest populations exceed economic thresholds, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Use a spray volume of 200-250 litres of water per acre for effective coverage.

**Recommended CIBRC-approved Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Guar:**

*   For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50 g per acre (or 0.2 g per litre of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 100 g per acre (or 0.4 g per litre of water).
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 400 ml per acre (or 1.6 ml per litre of water).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 400-600 ml per acre (or 1.6-2.4 ml per litre of water), particularly effective against thrips and leafhoppers.

*   Specifically for Whiteflies and Hoppers:
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 600 ml per acre (or 2.4 ml per litre of water), effective against nymphs.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (or 0.24 g per litre of water), acts as a feeding blocker.

**V. General Precautions:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the insecticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Safety Gear:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing during mixing and spraying.
*   **Spray Timing:** Spray early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, and to protect pollinators.
*   **Resistance Management:** Do not use the same insecticide repeatedly. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance.
*   **Environmental Safety:** Dispose of empty containers safely and responsibly. Avoid contamination of water bodies.

For any specific concerns or severe infestations, please consult with the local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for tailored advice.
