The symptom of "Drying up" (drying branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers) in Guar (Cluster Bean) is a general manifestation of various underlying issues, rather than a single disease. A precise diagnosis is crucial for effective management. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following approach, considering common problems in Haryana:

**1. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis:**
Carefully observe the pattern of drying:
*   **Whole plant drying:** Often indicates root/stem issues (wilts, root rots, nematodes, severe water stress).
*   **Localized drying (specific branches/leaves):** Could be blights, anthracnose, stem cankers, or localized pest damage.
*   **Progressive drying (from bottom to top or vice versa):** Provides clues about the pathogen's spread.
*   **Presence of lesions, spots, galls, or insect pests:** Look for any visible signs.

If unsure, collect plant samples (including roots and surrounding soil) and send them to the Plant Pathology or Nematology department at HAU, Hisar, for accurate diagnosis.

**2. Potential Causes and Management Strategies:**

**A. Fungal Diseases:**

*   **Fusarium Wilt (*Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cyamopsidis*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of lower leaves, followed by wilting and drying of the entire plant. Vascular discoloration (brown streaking) in the stem when cut open.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use resistant varieties if available.
        *   Practice long crop rotations (3-4 years) with non-host crops.
        *   Maintain good field sanitation.
        *   **Chemical Control:**
            *   **Seed Treatment:**
                *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
                *   OR **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Soil Drench (at early symptom appearance):**
                *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/L water, apply 200-300 ml solution per plant around the root zone.

*   **Alternaria Blight (*Alternaria cyamopsidis*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Small, dark brown, irregular spots on leaves, which enlarge and coalesce, leading to drying and defoliation. Can also affect stems and pods.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
            *   OR **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
            *   OR **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 200 ml/acre (or 1 ml/L water).

*   **Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, often with a reddish-brown margin. Severe infection leads to drying of affected parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Practice crop rotation.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
            *   OR **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water).

*   **Root Rot (e.g., *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Sclerotium rolfsii*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of plants, often in patches. Roots and stem base show rotting, discoloration, and sometimes white fungal growth or sclerotia.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil drainage.
        *   Deep ploughing during summer to expose fungal propagules to sunlight.
        *   **Seed Treatment:**
            *   **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP @ 2-3 g/kg seed.
            *   OR **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Biological Control:**
            *   Seed treatment with *Trichoderma viride* @ 4 g/kg seed or soil application @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure.

**B. Bacterial Diseases:**

*   **Bacterial Blight (*Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. cyamopsidis*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves, which turn brown and necrotic, often surrounded by a yellow halo. Lesions can coalesce, leading to large blighted areas and drying of leaves. Can also affect stems and pods.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use disease-free seeds.
        *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during humid conditions.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP @ 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water) mixed with a sticker.

**C. Nematodes:**

*   **Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, wilting, and premature drying of plants due to damaged roots. Characteristic galls (swellings) on roots.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals).
        *   Deep ploughing in summer.
        *   Use resistant varieties if available.
        *   **Biological Control:**
            *   Soil application of *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* @ 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg farmyard manure.

**D. Physiological/Environmental Stress:**

*   **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves. Drought causes overall plant desiccation, while waterlogging leads to root suffocation and rot, mimicking wilt symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (flowering and pod development).
        *   Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Severe deficiencies of essential nutrients (e.g., Nitrogen, Potassium) can lead to yellowing, necrosis, and premature drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to identify deficiencies.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers as per recommendations for Guar.

*   **High Temperatures/Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Scorching of leaves, wilting, and drying, especially during hot, dry winds.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure adequate soil moisture during heat waves.
        *   Consider planting heat-tolerant varieties.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable management.
*   **Seed Quality:** Always use certified, healthy seeds.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce inoculum.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Essential for managing soil-borne diseases and nematodes.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure plants receive adequate nutrients to boost their natural resistance.

By carefully observing the symptoms and following these guidelines, you can effectively address the "Drying up" problem in your Guar crop.
