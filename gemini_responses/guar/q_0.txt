As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Guar (cluster bean) in Haryana. Effective disease management relies on an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical interventions.

### General Preventive Measures (Cultural Practices)

These practices are crucial for minimizing disease incidence across all fungal pathogens:

*   **Use Certified Disease-Free Seeds:** Always source seeds from reliable suppliers to prevent seed-borne diseases.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides before sowing to protect against early-stage infections.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Guar or other susceptible legumes in the same field. A 2-3 year rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) helps reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest to reduce overwintering inoculum.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush growth more susceptible to fungal infections. Provide balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and impede air circulation.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, cultivate disease-resistant or tolerant Guar varieties.

### Specific Fungal Disease Control in Guar

Here's how to manage the specific diseases you've mentioned:

#### 1. Alternaria (Leaf Spot/Blight)

*   **Symptoms:** Appears as small, dark, circular spots on leaves, which enlarge and develop concentric rings, often with a yellow halo. Severe infection can lead to blight, defoliation, and stem lesions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement general preventive measures as above.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed or **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.5-3 g/kg seed.
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   Spray at the first appearance of symptoms and repeat at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity.
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
            *   **Chlorothalonil** 75% WP @ 1.5-2.0 kg/acre (or 2.0-2.5 g/L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.25 ml/L water).
            *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC @ 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.25-0.3 ml/L water).

#### 2. Anthracnose

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by dark, sunken lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, often with a reddish-brown margin. In humid conditions, pinkish spore masses may be visible in the center of lesions.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free seeds and practice crop rotation. Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed or **Thiram** 75% WS @ 2.5 g/kg seed.
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   Apply protective sprays starting from early crop stages if conditions are favorable for disease development.
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water).
            *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP @ 2.0-2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP @ 500 g/acre (or 0.5 g/L water).
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.25 ml/L water).

#### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect Guar.

#### 4. Blight (General Fungal)

*   For general fungal blights, the recommendations for Alternaria (Leaf Spot/Blight) are generally effective, as Alternaria blight is a common fungal blight in Guar. If other specific fungal blights are identified, please consult HAU experts for targeted advice.

#### 5. Brown Spot

*   This is not known to affect Guar.

#### 6. Downy Mildew

*   This is not a commonly reported major disease of Guar in Haryana.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew

*   **Symptoms:** Appears as white, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, stems, and pods. Infected leaves may turn yellow, curl, and drop prematurely, leading to reduced photosynthesis and yield.
*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Cultural:** Ensure good air circulation through proper plant spacing. Avoid excessive nitrogen.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:**
            *   Spray at the first sign of white powdery patches.
            *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP @ 2.0-3.0 kg/acre (or 2.5-3.0 g/L water).
            *   **Hexaconazole** 5% SC @ 400-500 ml/acre (or 0.4-0.5 ml/L water).
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 200-250 ml/acre (or 0.2-0.25 ml/L water).
            *   **Tebuconazole** 250 EC @ 250-300 ml/acre (or 0.25-0.3 ml/L water).
            *   **Myclobutanil** 10% WP @ 200-250 g/acre (or 0.2-0.25 g/L water).

#### 8. Grey Mildew

*   This is not known to affect Guar.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control. Use appropriate water volume (typically 200-400 L/acre for field crops) and nozzle type.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Monitor your crop regularly for early detection of disease symptoms.
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current disease pressure.
