Scale insects and Mealybugs are known to affect Guar (Cluster Bean) and can cause significant damage by sucking sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced pod formation. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, interfering with photosynthesis.

Effective control involves an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach:

**1. Cultural Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts or entire plants to prevent further spread.
*   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote healthy plant growth, making plants more resilient to pest attack. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can favor sucking pest multiplication.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

**3. Chemical Control (when pest population reaches economic threshold):**
When the infestation is severe and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and stems where these pests often reside.

For effective control of both Scale insects and Mealybugs in Guar, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:

*   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply 500-600 ml per acre. This is an insect growth regulator particularly effective against nymphs of scales and mealybugs.
*   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply 200-250 ml per acre. This is a systemic insecticide with translaminar action, providing good control of hidden pests.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-150 ml per acre. A systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply 50-100 g per acre. Another systemic insecticide providing good control of sucking pests.
*   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply 330-400 ml per acre. A contact and systemic organophosphate insecticide.
*   **Acephate 75% SP:** Apply 250-300 g per acre. A systemic organophosphate insecticide.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Water Volume:** Always use adequate water volume (e.g., 200-300 litres per acre) to ensure proper spray coverage.
*   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during the early stages of infestation for best results.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application. Observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) before harvesting.
