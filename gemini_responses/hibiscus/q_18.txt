As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of growth regulators and micronutrients on Hibiscus in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand that growth regulators and hormones should be used with extreme caution and only when a specific need is identified, as incorrect application can cause significant damage to plants. Boron, while essential, is a micronutrient, not a hormone.

Here are the recommendations for the substances you mentioned:

*   **Ethephon** (Technical name for Ethrel):
    *   While **Ethephon** is a growth regulator, its use for general flower promotion in Hibiscus is not a standard recommendation in horticultural practices in Haryana. Incorrect application can lead to adverse effects such as premature flower or leaf drop. It is sometimes used for specific purposes like defoliation for propagation or synchronized flowering in commercial settings, but these are specialized applications and not for routine growth regulation or flower enhancement by general growers. Therefore, a general recommended dose for beneficial growth regulation in Hibiscus is not provided.

*   **2,4-D**:
    *   This is not known to be recommended for use as a growth regulator on Hibiscus. **2,4-D** is primarily a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds, and its application, even at very low concentrations, is highly phytotoxic and detrimental to Hibiscus plants, which are broadleaf dicots. Its use will severely damage or kill Hibiscus.

*   **Boron**:
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for cell wall formation, sugar transport, pollen germination, and overall plant health, including flowering. Hibiscus can suffer from Boron deficiency, which may lead to poor flowering and distorted growth.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   If Boron deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil/tissue analysis, a foliar spray can be applied.
        *   Use **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at a concentration of **1.5-2.0 g/L** of water.
        *   Spray evenly to cover the foliage, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.
        *   Repeat the application if necessary, typically after 15-20 days, based on plant response and deficiency severity.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Soil Application):**
        *   For soil application in Boron-deficient soils, **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** can be applied at a rate of **10-15 kg/acre**, mixed well with the soil before planting or as a top dressing. This should ideally be based on soil test recommendations to avoid toxicity, as excess Boron can be harmful.

Always ensure proper diagnosis before applying any growth regulator or micronutrient. For specific issues, it is advisable to consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension services.
