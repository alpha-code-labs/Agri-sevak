As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified fertilizer application guidelines for Hibiscus in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a **soil test** is always the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and tailor a precise fertilizer program.

**General Principles for Hibiscus Fertilization:**
Hibiscus are heavy feeders, especially during their active growth and flowering periods. They benefit from a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients.

**Recommended Doses (per mature plant per year, split into 3-4 applications):**

**1. Nitrogen (N) Sources:**

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 200-300 g **Urea** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 3-4 applications. For example, 50-75 g per application, applied around the drip line and watered in thoroughly. Apply in early spring, early monsoon, and post-monsoon.
*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid, 4% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during active growth and flowering stages, at 15-20 day intervals. Ensure good leaf coverage.

**2. Phosphorus (P) Sources:**

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP, 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 100-150 g **Diammonium Phosphate** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2 applications. For example, 50-75 g per application, applied in early spring and early monsoon. Incorporate lightly into the soil and water well. If using DAP, reduce the amount of Urea accordingly as DAP also provides Nitrogen.
*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid, 8% N, 16% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water for foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during active growth and flowering stages, at 15-20 day intervals.
*   **Single Superphosphate (SSP, 14.5% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Dose:** 300-500 g **Single Superphosphate** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2 applications. For example, 150-250 g per application, applied in early spring and early monsoon. Incorporate lightly into the soil and water well. SSP also provides Sulphur.

**3. Potassium (K) Sources:**

*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP, 60% K2O) / Sulphate of Potash (SOP, 50% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 120-170 g **Muriate of Potash** OR 150-200 g **Sulphate of Potash** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2-3 applications. For example, 50-80 g per application, applied in early spring, early monsoon, and post-monsoon. Apply around the drip line and water thoroughly. Sulphate of Potash is preferred if soil salinity is a concern or if additional Sulphur is needed.

**4. Complex NPK Fertilizers:**

*   **NPK (e.g., 19:19:19, 17:17:17, 10:26:26):**
    *   **Dose:** 400-600 g of a balanced **NPK (e.g., 19:19:19)** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 3-4 applications. For example, 100-150 g per application, applied in early spring, early monsoon, and post-monsoon. Broadcast around the drip line, lightly incorporate, and water well. Adjust the dose based on the specific NPK ratio to meet the overall nutrient requirements.

**5. Sulphur (S) Sources:**

*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):**
    *   **Dose:** 15-25 g **Elemental Sulphur** per plant per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply once a year, preferably during early spring or monsoon, by incorporating it into the soil around the plant. This is usually sufficient if not already supplied by SSP or SOP.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to get your soil tested by HAU or a certified lab. This will provide precise recommendations based on your soil's nutrient status.
*   **Young Plants:** For young or newly planted Hibiscus, reduce the recommended doses by half to one-third.
*   **Potted Plants:** Potted Hibiscus require more frequent, smaller doses of fertilizer due to nutrient leaching. Use about 1/4th to 1/2th of the recommended dose for ground plants, applied every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.
*   **Application Method:** Always apply granular fertilizers around the drip line (the area under the outermost branches) and not directly at the base of the stem. Lightly incorporate into the soil and water thoroughly immediately after application to prevent root burn and ensure nutrient uptake.
*   **Timing:** Avoid fertilizing during the dormant period (winter) or when the plant is stressed (e.g., due to drought or disease).
*   **Over-fertilization:** Excessive fertilizer can lead to nutrient imbalance, root burn, and environmental pollution. Always follow recommended doses.
