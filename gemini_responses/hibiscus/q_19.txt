As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Hibiscus plants, suitable for conditions in Haryana.

**General Approach to Nutrient Management:**

Before applying any fertilizers, it is crucial to:
1.  **Observe Symptoms Carefully:** While visual symptoms can indicate a deficiency, they can sometimes be misleading or confused with other issues.
2.  **Conduct Soil Testing:** This is the most accurate method to determine the actual nutrient status of your soil and the precise amount of fertilizer required. HAU recommends regular soil testing for optimal plant health and efficient nutrient use.
3.  **Start with Lower Doses:** Always begin with the lower end of the recommended dosage and observe the plant's response before increasing. Over-fertilization can be more damaging than under-fertilization.
4.  **Ensure Proper Watering:** Fertilizers are best absorbed when the soil has adequate moisture. Water thoroughly after soil application.

Here's how to address specific macro-nutrient deficiencies in Hibiscus:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
*   Stunted growth and reduced vigor.
*   Leaves may appear pale green rather than a healthy dark green.
*   Reduced flowering.

**Correction:**
Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth and chlorophyll production.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 5-10 grams per plant of **Urea** (46% N) or **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N) or **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N) around the base of the plant, ensuring it doesn't touch the stem. Lightly incorporate into the soil and water immediately. Repeat every 4-6 weeks if symptoms persist, based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick boost):**
    *   Dissolve 2-3 grams of **Urea** per litre of water. Spray the foliage thoroughly, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, avoiding hot midday sun. Repeat every 10-14 days until symptoms improve.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves, especially on the undersides and older leaves.
*   Stunted growth, particularly root development.
*   Delayed or poor flowering and fruit set.
*   Leaves may appear stiff and brittle.

**Correction:**
Phosphorus is vital for energy transfer, root development, and flowering.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 10-15 grams per plant of **Single Superphosphate** (16% P2O5) or 5-8 grams per plant of **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (18% N, 46% P2O5) around the plant base. Incorporate into the soil and water well. Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so ensure it's placed where roots can access it. Repeat every 2-3 months or as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   Foliar application of phosphorus is generally less effective for long-term correction due to poor absorption. Soil application is preferred. If a quick boost is needed, a foliar spray of a balanced NPK fertilizer with a higher P ratio (e.g., 1:2:1 or 1:3:1) can be used at 2-3 grams per litre.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Yellowing and browning (scorching or burning) of leaf margins and tips, primarily on older leaves.
*   Weak stems and reduced plant vigor.
*   Poor flower development, with smaller or fewer blooms.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases, pests, and environmental stresses (drought, cold).

**Correction:**
Potassium is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant strength and flowering.

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 5-10 grams per plant of **Muriate of Potash** (Potassium Chloride, 60% K2O) or **Sulphate of Potash** (Potassium Sulphate, 50% K2O) around the plant base. Incorporate into the soil and water thoroughly. Repeat every 6-8 weeks or as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Foliar Application (for quick boost):**
    *   Dissolve 2-3 grams of **Sulphate of Potash** per litre of water. Spray the foliage thoroughly, preferably in the morning or late afternoon. Repeat every 10-14 days until symptoms improve.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Always aim for balanced nutrition. Over-applying one nutrient can sometimes lead to deficiencies of other nutrients or cause toxicity.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly can significantly improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor your Hibiscus plants for signs of improvement or any new symptoms after applying fertilizers.
