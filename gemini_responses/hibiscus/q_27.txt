As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Hibiscus cultivation in Haryana:

### Climate Requirements for Hibiscus

Hibiscus (specifically *Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*, the common garden hibiscus) thrives in warm, tropical to subtropical climates.

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Ideal Day Temperature:** 20°C to 35°C.
    *   **Ideal Night Temperature:** 15°C to 25°C.
    *   Hibiscus can tolerate the high summer temperatures of Haryana (often exceeding 40°C) if provided with adequate water and some afternoon shade during the peak heat.
    *   They are sensitive to frost. Temperatures below 5°C can cause damage, and prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures will kill the plant. In Haryana, protection from severe winter frost is crucial, especially for young plants or sensitive varieties.
*   **Sunlight:**
    *   Requires full sun exposure for at least 6-8 hours daily to produce abundant blooms.
    *   In the intense summer heat of Haryana, a location that receives morning sun and some partial shade during the hottest part of the afternoon (1 PM - 4 PM) can be beneficial to prevent leaf scorch and wilting, while still ensuring good flowering.

### Soil Type Requirements for Hibiscus

Hibiscus prefers fertile, well-draining soils rich in organic matter.

*   **Texture:**
    *   **Loamy soils** (sandy loam to clay loam) are ideal as they offer a good balance of water retention and drainage.
    *   Heavy clay soils can be problematic due to poor drainage, while excessively sandy soils may not retain enough moisture and nutrients.
*   **pH:**
    *   Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH is preferred, typically ranging from **6.0 to 7.0**.
    *   In Haryana, many soils are naturally alkaline. If the soil pH is above 7.5, amendments may be necessary to bring it into the optimal range.
*   **Organic Matter:**
    *   High organic matter content is crucial for soil fertility, structure, and water-holding capacity. Incorporating well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) or compost is highly recommended.

### Drainage Requirements for Hibiscus

Excellent drainage is paramount for the healthy growth of Hibiscus.

*   **Waterlogging:** Hibiscus plants are highly susceptible to root rot if their roots sit in waterlogged conditions for extended periods. This is a common issue in heavy clay soils or areas with poor subsurface drainage.
*   **Indicators of Good Drainage:** Water should drain away from the root zone within 15-30 minutes after irrigation.
*   **Improving Drainage:**
    *   **Amending Soil:** For heavy clay soils, incorporate significant amounts of organic matter (compost, FYM) and coarse sand to improve soil structure and porosity.
    *   **Raised Beds:** Planting Hibiscus in raised beds can effectively improve drainage, especially in areas with naturally heavy or poorly draining soils.
    *   **Container Planting:** For potted Hibiscus, ensure the pots have adequate drainage holes and use a well-draining potting mix.

By adhering to these guidelines, growers in Haryana can successfully cultivate healthy and floriferous Hibiscus plants.
