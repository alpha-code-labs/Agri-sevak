Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the protection of your Hibiscus plants from wild animals. Protecting ornamental plants like Hibiscus from wild animals primarily involves physical exclusion and habitat management, as chemical repellents specifically approved by CIBRC for general wild animal deterrence on ornamental plants are not commonly recommended or widely available for this purpose.

Here are scientifically verified methods to protect your Hibiscus from wild animals:

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing:** This is the most effective method for deterring larger animals like Nilgai, wild boar, and deer.
        *   **Wire Mesh/Chain-link Fencing:** Install a sturdy fence around your garden or the specific area where Hibiscus plants are located. The height and gauge of the wire should be appropriate for the size and strength of the animals you are trying to deter. For animals like Nilgai, a fence of at least 1.8 to 2.4 meters (6 to 8 feet) in height is often necessary, and it should be dug into the ground to prevent burrowing animals like wild boar from getting underneath.
        *   **Electric Fencing (Low Voltage):** In larger agricultural settings or where animal pressure is very high, a low-voltage electric fence can be considered. However, this requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and adherence to safety regulations to prevent harm to humans and non-target animals. It is generally not recommended for small home gardens due to safety concerns and complexity.
    *   **Individual Plant Cages/Netting:** For a few prized Hibiscus plants, individual cages made of sturdy wire mesh can be placed around them. This provides direct protection to the plant itself. Netting can also be used, especially for smaller animals or to protect specific parts of the plant.

*   **Cultural Practices and Habitat Modification:**
    *   **Remove Attractants:** Keep the area around your Hibiscus plants clean. Remove fallen fruits, leaves, or any other plant debris that might attract animals looking for food.
    *   **Pruning:** Keep the lower branches of your Hibiscus pruned to make them less accessible or appealing to grazing animals.
    *   **Companion Planting:** Plant species that are known to be unpalatable or have strong deterrent scents around your Hibiscus. While not foolproof, some animals may avoid areas with strong-smelling plants like Marigolds, Garlic, or certain herbs.
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your plants and the surrounding area for signs of animal activity. Early detection of damage can help you reinforce protective measures.

*   **Sensory Deterrents (Limited Effectiveness):**
    *   **Noise Makers/Visual Scare Devices:** Devices like scarecrows, reflective tapes, or noise-making devices can offer temporary deterrence. However, wild animals often habituate to these over time, reducing their long-term effectiveness.
    *   **Scent-based Repellents:** Some natural strong-smelling substances (e.g., diluted cow urine, chili powder sprays) are sometimes used locally. However, their effectiveness is often short-lived, requires frequent reapplication, and their scientific efficacy for broad wild animal deterrence is variable.

Regarding chemical repellents, it is important to note that CIBRC (Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee) primarily approves technical chemicals for use as insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and specific rodenticides. **There are no CIBRC-approved technical chemical names specifically recommended or widely available for general wild animal repellency on ornamental plants like Hibiscus in India.** Therefore, physical barriers and cultural practices remain the most reliable and scientifically endorsed methods for protecting your Hibiscus plants from wild animals.
