As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here are the recommended cultivation practices for Hibiscus, focusing primarily on ornamental varieties (*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*) which are commonly grown in Haryana. While propagation from seeds is possible, vegetative propagation through cuttings is generally preferred for maintaining desired characteristics and faster establishment.

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
*   **For Seed Propagation:**
    *   Seeds are typically sown in nursery beds or trays filled with a well-draining potting mix. This allows for better control over germination conditions and easier management of young seedlings.
    *   Sow seeds in rows, approximately 5-10 cm apart, or broadcast thinly in a prepared nursery bed.
    *   The ideal time for sowing seeds in Haryana is during spring (February-March) or the monsoon season (June-July) when temperatures are conducive for germination.
    *   Pre-soaking seeds in warm water for 24 hours can improve germination rates.
*   **For Vegetative Propagation (Cuttings - Most Common for Ornamental Hibiscus):**
    *   Semi-hardwood cuttings (15-20 cm long with 3-4 nodes) are taken from healthy mother plants.
    *   These cuttings are planted directly into nursery beds, polybags, or rooting trays.
    *   Application of a rooting hormone such as **Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)** is highly recommended to enhance root development.

**2. Planting Depth:**
*   **For Seeds:**
    *   Sow seeds at a depth of 1-2 cm. Cover lightly with fine soil or potting mix.
*   **For Rooted Cuttings/Transplanted Seedlings:**
    *   Plant the rooted cuttings or seedlings at the same depth as they were in the nursery or polybag. Ensure that the root ball is fully covered and the plant is stable. For cuttings, ensure at least 2-3 nodes are buried below the soil surface to encourage rooting.

**3. Spacing:**
*   **For Ornamental Hibiscus (*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*) in the field/garden:**
    *   **Individual Plants:** For standalone specimen plants or in mixed borders, a spacing of 1.5 meters (row to row) x 1.5 meters (plant to plant) is generally recommended to allow for adequate growth and air circulation.
    *   **Hedges:** If planting for a hedge, a closer spacing of 0.75 meters (row to row) x 0.75 meters (plant to plant) can be adopted.
*   **For Roselle (*Hibiscus sabdariffa* - if grown as a field crop for calyx/fiber):**
    *   Row to row: 60-90 cm
    *   Plant to plant: 30-45 cm

**4. Seed Dose:**
*   **For Ornamental Hibiscus (*Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*):**
    *   Seed propagation is less common for commercial ornamental production due to genetic variability and the availability of superior cultivars propagated vegetatively. Therefore, a standard "seed dose per acre" is not typically calculated for this purpose.
    *   If seeds are used for raising nursery plants for a small area, a few grams of seeds would be sufficient.
*   **For Roselle (*Hibiscus sabdariffa* - if grown as a field crop):**
    *   For fiber type: 8-10 kg/acre
    *   For calyx type: 4-6 kg/acre
