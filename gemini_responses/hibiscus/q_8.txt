Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests on Hibiscus. These pests can significantly damage the plant by feeding on sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, leaf curl, and reduced flowering. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes sooty mould growth.

Here's a comprehensive approach to manage Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla in Hibiscus:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable pest control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Hibiscus plants frequently, especially the undersides of leaves and new shoots, to detect pests early.
    *   **Water Spray:** For mild infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge many pests from the plant. Repeat every few days.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or shoots to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around Hibiscus plants free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Plant Health:** Ensure proper nutrition and watering to maintain plant vigour, making them more resilient to pest attacks.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps. These beneficial insects prey on aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides if natural enemies are present.

3.  **Physical Control:**
    *   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps near your Hibiscus plants. These are effective in trapping adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips, helping to monitor and reduce their populations.

**Chemical Control (When Infestation is Severe):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, or the infestation is severe, judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**Recommended Insecticides for Sucking Pests in Hibiscus:**

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a broad range of sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water. Another systemic insecticide with excellent efficacy against sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. A neonicotinoid insecticide that is effective against various sucking pests, including those resistant to other chemicals.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water. A contact and systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests, suitable for severe infestations.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 g per litre of water. This insecticide specifically targets aphids and whiteflies by disrupting their feeding behaviour.

*   **For Whiteflies (especially nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is an insect growth regulator primarily effective against whitefly nymphs and also has some effect on leafhoppers.

*   **For Early Infestations / Organic Approach:**
    *   **Azadirachtin (Neem oil extract) 1500 ppm (or higher concentration):** Apply at 2 - 5 ml per litre of water (dosage depends on the concentration of Azadirachtin). This botanical insecticide acts as an antifeedant and growth disruptor, effective against early stages of many sucking pests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Timing:** Spray during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to avoid phytotoxicity and maximize efficacy.
*   **Rotation:** To prevent pest resistance, rotate between insecticides with different active ingredients and modes of action.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) during mixing and spraying. Keep chemicals out of reach of children and pets.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage sucking pests and ensure the healthy growth and beautiful blooms of your Hibiscus plants.
