Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies are known to affect Hibiscus plants, causing damage to leaves, flowers, and sometimes stems or roots. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides when necessary.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Hibiscus plants frequently for signs of pest activity (e.g., chewed leaves, holes, presence of larvae or adult insects). Early detection is key.
*   **Hand-picking:** For small infestations, especially of larger beetles, weevils, or sawfly larvae, hand-picking and destroying them can be effective.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest populations. Keep the area around the plants free of weeds and debris that can harbor pests.
*   **Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can dislodge some pests, especially sawfly larvae, from the foliage.

**2. Chemical Control (for moderate to severe infestations):**

When cultural methods are insufficient, CIBRC-approved insecticides can be used. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some recommended technical chemicals:

*   **For Beetles and Weevils (adults and some larvae):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against chewing and sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Another systemic option.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. A contact and stomach insecticide.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. Effective contact insecticide.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. It has contact, stomach, and some systemic action.

*   **For Sawflies (larvae):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water. A broad-spectrum contact insecticide.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 50% EC:** Apply as a foliar spray at 1.5 - 2.0 ml per litre of water. A broad-spectrum contact and stomach insecticide.
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply as a foliar spray at 0.2 - 0.3 ml per litre of water. This is a biological origin insecticide effective against larvae of sawflies and caterpillars.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** As mentioned above, it is also effective against sawfly larvae.
    *   **Cypermethrin 25% EC:** As mentioned above, it is also effective against sawfly larvae.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy. Avoid spraying during strong winds.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and applying chemicals.
*   **Environmental Impact:** Be mindful of beneficial insects and pollinators. Avoid spraying when plants are in full bloom if possible, or spray late in the evening when pollinators are less active.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and the exact pest species, it is always advisable to consult with agricultural extension officers or experts at HAU.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage beetles, weevils, and sawflies on your Hibiscus plants.
