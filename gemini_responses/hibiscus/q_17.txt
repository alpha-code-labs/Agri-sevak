As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures in Hibiscus, based on scientific principles and suitability for Haryana's conditions:

Organic manures are crucial for improving soil health, structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, leading to robust growth and abundant flowering in Hibiscus.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM)**
    *   **Dose:** For a mature Hibiscus plant (2-3 years old or more), apply **5-10 kg** of well-decomposed FYM per plant annually. For younger plants (less than 2 years old), apply **2-3 kg** per plant.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate the FYM into the soil around the base of the plant, ensuring it's not in direct contact with the stem, and then water thoroughly. The best time for application is during late winter or early spring before the active growth phase begins.

*   **Vermicompost**
    *   **Dose:** For a mature Hibiscus plant, apply **1-2 kg** of vermicompost per plant. For younger plants, apply **250-500 g** per plant.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be applied twice a year, once in early spring and again in late monsoon/early autumn. Spread it evenly around the plant's root zone and lightly mix it with the topsoil, followed by watering.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based Biostimulant)**
    *   **Nature:** Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, rich in natural plant growth regulators, amino acids, and micronutrients. It enhances nutrient uptake, improves plant vigour, and boosts flowering, rather than providing bulk nutrients like FYM or vermicompost.
    *   **Foliar Spray Dose:** Dilute **2-3 ml** of Sagarika per litre of water.
    *   **Foliar Spray Application:** Spray the solution evenly on the foliage (both upper and lower leaf surfaces) during the active growth and flowering stages. Apply every 15-20 days, preferably in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching.
    *   **Soil Drench Dose:** Dilute **10-20 ml** of Sagarika per plant in sufficient water (e.g., 1-2 litres) for soil application.
    *   **Soil Drench Application:** Apply the diluted solution directly to the soil around the base of the plant once a month during the growing season.

**General Application Tips:**
*   Always ensure the organic manures are well-decomposed to avoid nutrient lock-up and pest issues.
*   After applying solid organic manures, lightly incorporate them into the topsoil and water the plant thoroughly to help nutrients leach into the root zone.
*   Adjust doses based on the plant's size, age, and observed vigour.
