Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Scale insects and Mealybugs on your Hibiscus plants. Both are common sucking pests that can significantly damage the plant if not managed effectively.

Here's an integrated approach for their control:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defense):**

1.  **Manual Removal:** For small infestations, gently wipe off mealybugs with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol or a strong jet of water. Scales can be carefully scraped off with a soft brush or fingernail.
2.  **Pruning:** Heavily infested leaves, stems, or branches should be pruned and immediately destroyed (burnt or bagged and discarded) to prevent further spread.
3.  **Regular Inspection:** Regularly inspect your Hibiscus plants, especially the undersides of leaves, stem joints, and new growth, to detect infestations early.
4.  **Isolation:** If possible, isolate newly acquired plants for a few weeks to ensure they are pest-free before introducing them to your existing collection.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   Encourage natural predators like ladybugs, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which feed on scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

**III. Chemical Control (When Infestation is Severe):**

When cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where these pests hide. Rotate chemicals with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

**For both Scale Insects and Mealybugs, the following CIBRC approved insecticides are effective:**

1.  **Botanical Insecticide:**
    *   **Neem oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm or 3000 ppm):** Mix 5 ml of 1500 ppm formulation per litre of water. Spray thoroughly, ensuring coverage on all plant parts. Repeat every 7-10 days as needed. It acts as an antifeedant, repellent, and insect growth regulator.

2.  **Systemic Insecticides (Effective against sucking pests like scales and mealybugs):**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Mix 0.5-1 ml per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray. This is a systemic insecticide that gets absorbed by the plant and kills pests feeding on it.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Mix 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray. Another systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Mix 0.2-0.4 g per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray. This is also a systemic insecticide with translaminar action.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Mix 1.25-1.5 ml per litre of water. Apply as a foliar spray. This is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that primarily affects the nymphal stages by inhibiting chitin synthesis, preventing them from molting successfully. It is particularly effective against scale insect crawlers and mealybug nymphs.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize evaporation and maximize absorption.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem crevices where pests hide.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, mask, and eye protection while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   **Follow Label Instructions:** Strictly adhere to the dosage and safety instructions provided on the product label.
*   **Repeat Application:** For severe infestations, a second application after 7-10 days might be necessary, especially for scales, to target newly hatched crawlers.

By adopting an integrated approach combining these methods, you can effectively manage scale insects and mealybugs on your Hibiscus plants.
