Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Hibiscus is a common and concerning symptom, often indicative of underlying stress or disease. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to diagnose and address the root cause.

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and their management strategies:

### **I. Abiotic (Environmental/Cultural) Factors:**

These are often the primary culprits for general drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress (Both Under and Over-watering):**
    *   **Under-watering:** Insufficient moisture leads to wilting and desiccation.
    *   **Over-watering/Poor Drainage:** Waterlogged conditions deprive roots of oxygen, leading to root rot (physiological, not necessarily pathogenic initially), which impairs water uptake, causing symptoms similar to under-watering.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure consistent and adequate watering, especially during hot, dry periods. Check soil moisture before watering.
        *   Ensure excellent drainage. If potted, use pots with drainage holes and a well-draining potting mix. For ground plants, amend heavy clay soils with organic matter to improve drainage.
        *   Mulch around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies/Imbalances:**
    *   Severe deficiencies, particularly of macronutrients (N, P, K) or certain micronutrients, can weaken the plant, making it susceptible to stress and causing leaf yellowing, scorching, and eventual drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct a soil test to determine specific deficiencies.
        *   Apply a balanced fertilizer as per recommendations. For general health, a slow-release granular fertilizer or liquid feed with micronutrients can be beneficial.

3.  **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:**
    *   Intense summer heat in Haryana can cause leaves and flowers to scorch and dry out, especially if the plant is not well-established or adequately watered.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Provide partial shade during the hottest part of the day, especially for young plants or varieties sensitive to direct, intense sun.
        *   Ensure adequate watering to help the plant cope with heat.
        *   Mulching helps keep soil temperatures stable.

4.  **Soil Salinity:**
    *   High salt content in soil or irrigation water (common in some parts of Haryana) can cause osmotic stress, leading to wilting, leaf tip burn, and overall drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Use good quality irrigation water.
        *   Leach the soil periodically by applying large volumes of fresh water to flush out accumulated salts, ensuring good drainage.
        *   Incorporate organic matter into the soil to improve soil structure and buffering capacity.

### **II. Biotic (Disease) Factors:**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider diseases.

1.  **Root Rot and Wilt Diseases (e.g., Fusarium Wilt, Phytophthora Root Rot):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves and branches, often progressing rapidly. The vascular tissue (stem cross-section) might show discoloration (brown or black streaks). Roots may appear mushy and discolored.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil drainage immediately.
        *   Remove and destroy severely infected plants to prevent spread.
        *   For early stages or as a preventive measure in susceptible areas:
            *   Drench the soil around the base of the plant with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 1-2 g/L water or **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5-1 ml/L water. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
            *   For *Phytophthora* specific root rot, drench with **Fosetyl-aluminium 80% WP** at 2.5 g/L water or **Propamocarb Hydrochloride 72.2% SL** at 2-3 ml/L water.

2.  **Stem Blight/Canker:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Localized drying of branches, often starting from the tip or at a specific point on the stem, accompanied by sunken lesions or cankers on the bark.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune out affected branches well below the visible symptoms, making clean cuts. Sterilize pruning tools between cuts.
        *   Apply a protective paste of **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** (30-40 g mixed in 100 ml water) on large pruning wounds.
        *   Spray the plant with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L water to protect against further infection, especially after pruning.

### **III. Biotic (Pest) Factors:**

While less common for widespread "drying up" of the entire plant, certain pests can cause localized drying or severe stress leading to drying.

1.  **Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, general decline, wilting even with adequate water, and characteristic galls or swellings on the roots. Damaged roots impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to drying symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve soil health with abundant organic matter.
        *   Solarize the soil before planting in affected areas.
        *   Use bio-nematicides containing *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* as per product instructions for soil application.

2.  **Stem Borers:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden drying and dieback of individual branches, often with visible entry/exit holes on the stem and frass (sawdust-like material) near the holes.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune and destroy affected branches.
        *   If holes are visible, inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** (diluted 1:10 with water) into the borer holes using a syringe, then seal the hole with mud or wax.
        *   For severe infestations, a soil drench around the base of the plant with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2-3 ml/L water can provide systemic protection.

3.  **Severe Sucking Pests (Aphids, Mealybugs, Whiteflies, Thrips, Mites):**
    *   While not directly causing "drying up" of branches, very heavy infestations can severely weaken the plant, leading to leaf distortion, yellowing, premature leaf drop, and overall stress, which can contribute to drying symptoms, especially on new growth and flowers.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Wash off pests with a strong stream of water.
        *   Encourage natural predators.
        *   For severe infestations, spray with **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL** at 0.5 ml/L water or **Thiamethoxam 25% WG** at 0.3 g/L water. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

### **General Preventive Measures:**

*   **Proper Site Selection:** Plant Hibiscus in a location with appropriate sunlight and good air circulation.
*   **Good Drainage:** Ensure the soil drains well to prevent root rot.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide regular, balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigor.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Routinely check your plants for early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any fallen leaves, flowers, or diseased plant parts.
*   **Pruning:** Prune dead or diseased branches promptly.

**Recommendation:**
Start by carefully observing your Hibiscus plant. Check the soil moisture, drainage, and look for any visible signs of pests or diseases on leaves, stems, and roots. Addressing abiotic factors first often resolves the issue. If symptoms persist, then consider specific disease or pest management.
