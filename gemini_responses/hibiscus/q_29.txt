As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Hibiscus plants in Haryana.

Firstly, it is important to clarify the terminology:
*   **Tinda (Praecitrullus fistulosus)** is a cucurbit vegetable and is not related to Hibiscus. Therefore, "Tinda dropping" does not apply to Hibiscus.
*   **Boll dropping** typically refers to the shedding of seed pods. While some Hibiscus species produce seed pods, their dropping is generally due to similar factors as flower drop.

Flower and seed pod (boll) dropping in Hibiscus is primarily a physiological response to various environmental stresses or cultural practices, rather than a specific disease or pest.

**Common Causes of Flower and Seed Pod Drop in Hibiscus:**

1.  **Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Both insufficient watering (dehydration) and excessive watering (leading to root rot and poor oxygenation) can cause flowers and buds to drop. Hibiscus prefers consistently moist but well-drained soil.
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** High temperatures (especially above 35-40°C, common in Haryana summers) or sudden drops in temperature can stress the plant.
    *   **Humidity:** Low atmospheric humidity can cause buds to dry out and drop prematurely.
    *   **Light:** Insufficient sunlight or sudden changes in light intensity can be a factor. Hibiscus requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
    *   **Wind:** Strong winds can physically damage and dislodge flowers.

2.  **Nutrient Imbalance:**
    *   **Excess Nitrogen:** Too much nitrogen can promote lush leafy growth at the expense of flowering and fruiting.
    *   **Deficiency of Phosphorus and Potassium:** These nutrients are crucial for flower and fruit development.
    *   **Micronutrient Deficiencies:** Deficiencies of boron, molybdenum, or other micronutrients can impair flower and seed set.

3.  **Pest Infestations:**
    *   Severe infestations of sucking pests (e.g., aphids, thrips, whiteflies, mites) on buds and young flowers can weaken them, leading to premature drop.

4.  **Pollination Issues:**
    *   Lack of successful pollination can lead to unfertilized flowers dropping.

5.  **Physiological Factors:**
    *   **Natural Abscission:** Plants naturally shed some flowers or young fruits if they cannot support all of them, especially when young.
    *   **Transplant Shock:** Recently transplanted plants may drop flowers as they adjust to the new environment.

**Control Measures for Flower and Seed Pod Drop in Hibiscus:**

Effective control involves optimizing cultural practices and addressing specific deficiencies or pest issues.

1.  **Optimise Water Management:**
    *   Ensure consistent soil moisture. Water deeply when the top 2-3 cm of soil feels dry to the touch.
    *   Avoid waterlogging by ensuring excellent drainage in pots or garden beds.

2.  **Manage Temperature and Humidity:**
    *   During peak summer in Haryana, provide some afternoon shade to protect plants from extreme heat.
    *   Consider misting the foliage during very hot and dry periods to increase local humidity, especially for potted plants.

3.  **Ensure Adequate Sunlight:**
    *   Plant Hibiscus in a location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.

4.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a soil test to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and pH levels. This is the most accurate way to guide fertilization.
    *   **Fertilization:**
        *   Use a balanced fertilizer with a higher phosphorus and potassium content (e.g., NPK ratio like 5-10-10 or 10-20-20) during the flowering season.
        *   Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which promotes foliage over flowers.
        *   If micronutrient deficiencies are suspected or confirmed by soil test:
            *   Apply a chelated micronutrient mixture as per product recommendations (typically 0.5-1 g/L water as a foliar spray).
            *   For boron deficiency, a foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1 g/L water can be applied, but use with caution as excess boron can be toxic.

5.  **Pest Management (if contributing to stress):**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for pests, especially on new growth and buds.
    *   For severe infestations of sucking pests (aphids, thrips, whiteflies):
        *   **Imidacloprid** (0.3-0.5 ml/L water)
        *   **Thiamethoxam** (0.2-0.4 g/L water)
        *   **Fipronil** (1-1.5 ml/L water)
    *   For mites:
        *   **Spiromesifen** (0.5-0.75 ml/L water)
    *   Always follow label instructions for application rates and safety precautions.

6.  **Encourage Pollination:**
    *   Plant other flowering plants nearby to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.

7.  **Pruning:**
    *   Light pruning can encourage new growth and more prolific flowering. Remove spent flowers to encourage new blooms.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce flower and seed pod dropping in your Hibiscus plants and promote healthier, more abundant blooms.
