Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to address micronutrient deficiencies in Hibiscus, which are common in our region due to soil characteristics and intensive cultivation.

Before applying any micronutrients, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity. This will help in precise application and avoid over-application, which can be detrimental.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Hibiscus:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Diagnosis:** Observe symptoms carefully, but confirm with a soil and/or leaf tissue analysis.
*   **Application Method:** Both soil application and foliar sprays are effective. Foliar sprays offer quicker correction, especially for iron, zinc, and manganese in high pH soils common in Haryana, where soil availability can be limited.
*   **Timing:** Apply during active growth periods, typically in spring and monsoon, or when symptoms are observed.
*   **Adjuvant:** Always add a good quality non-ionic spreader/sticker (surfactant) at recommended rates (e.g., 0.5-1 ml/L) to foliar sprays for better absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for spraying.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

1.  **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, small and narrow leaves (little leaf), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, often with a bronzed appearance.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-15 kg/acre or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 6-8 kg/acre, mixed with soil around the plant base, once a year or as per soil test recommendations.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 2.5-5 g/L of water. Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.

2.  **Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on the youngest leaves, which turn pale yellow or almost white, while the veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn white.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) at 20-25 kg/acre. However, in high pH soils, soil application of ferrous sulphate is often less effective.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 5 g/L of water. For better efficacy in high pH conditions, use **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-2 g/L of water. Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

3.  **Boron (B) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, distortion or malformation of new growth, cracking of stems, poor flower development, and sometimes dieback of growing points.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) at 4-6 kg/acre.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Borax** at 1-2 g/L of water. Alternatively, use **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 0.5-1 g/L of water. Spray 2-3 times, especially before flowering, at 10-15 day intervals.

4.  **Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, distorted and curled young leaves, stunted root growth, and sometimes weak stems. Symptoms appear on new growth as calcium is immobile in the plant.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate) at 200-500 kg/acre (as a soil amendment and Ca source) or **Calcium Nitrate** at 10-15 kg/acre.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Calcium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water or **Calcium Chloride** at 2-4 g/L of water. Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, focusing on new growth.

5.  **Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often leaving a green "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may turn reddish-purple in severe cases.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) at 10-15 kg/acre.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 5-10 g/L of water. Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

6.  **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less severe, sometimes accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots. Veins remain green.
    *   **Correction:**
        *   **Soil Application:** Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) at 8-10 kg/acre.
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Dissolve **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** at 2.5-5 g/L of water. Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.

Always ensure proper safety measures, including wearing gloves and protective eyewear, when handling any agricultural chemicals. Store chemicals safely away from children and pets.
