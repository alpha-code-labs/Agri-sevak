Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in Hibiscus in Haryana.

Here's how to approach each condition:

### 1. Scab

This is not known to affect Hibiscus. While Hibiscus can suffer from various fungal leaf spots, a specific disease commonly referred to as "Scab" (caused by *Elsinoë* species) is not a known or common issue for Hibiscus plants. If you are observing symptoms like raised, corky lesions, it might be a different fungal or environmental issue, and a sample could be brought to HAU for accurate diagnosis.

### 2. Canker

Cankers are sunken, discolored lesions on stems, branches, or trunks, often caused by fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria* species). They can lead to dieback of branches.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Carefully prune out all affected branches and stems. Make cuts into healthy wood, well below the visible canker.
    *   **Sanitation:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between cuts to prevent spreading the disease.
    *   **Plant Vigor:** Ensure the plant is well-nourished and watered appropriately to improve its natural resistance. Avoid mechanical injuries.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, a protective fungicide spray can be applied, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, rain).
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (2.5-3 g/L of water)
    *   **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L of water)
    *   **Mancozeb** (2-2.5 g/L of water)
    *   Apply as a thorough foliar spray, ensuring good coverage of stems and branches. Repeat applications may be necessary as per product label instructions.

### 3. Gummosis

Gummosis is the oozing of sap or gum from the bark of the plant. It is a symptom, not a disease itself, and often indicates stress, injury, or an underlying disease (like canker or root rot) or insect infestation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Identify the Cause:** Carefully inspect the plant for any signs of mechanical injury, insect borers, or cankers. Address the primary issue.
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure the soil has good drainage, as waterlogging can stress the plant and lead to root issues that manifest as gummosis.
    *   **Proper Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to enhance plant health and resilience.
    *   **Pruning:** If gummosis is associated with a canker, follow the pruning guidelines mentioned above for canker control.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If gummosis is linked to a fungal infection (e.g., canker), the fungicides mentioned for canker control can be used.
    *   For wound protection after pruning or scraping affected areas (if applicable), a paste of a copper-based fungicide can be applied.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** (Mix with a small amount of water to form a thick paste and apply directly to the affected area after cleaning).
    *   If root rot is suspected due to poor drainage, improving drainage is paramount. Fungicides are generally less effective if the underlying environmental issue is not resolved.

### 4. Lichen

Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on the bark of plants. They are generally harmless epiphytes, meaning they grow on the plant surface but do not parasitize it or draw nutrients from it. Their presence often indicates good air quality and a healthy, but possibly slow-growing or less vigorous, host plant.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **No Control Needed:** Typically, no control measures are required as lichens do not harm the Hibiscus plant. They do not block sunlight significantly or compete for nutrients.
    *   **Improve Air Circulation:** If desired for aesthetic reasons, improving air circulation around the plant by light pruning can sometimes reduce lichen growth.
    *   **Gentle Removal:** If you wish to remove them, you can gently scrub them off with a soft brush when the bark is wet, but this is usually unnecessary.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Chemical control is generally not recommended for lichens as they are harmless. Applying fungicides or herbicides specifically for lichen removal is usually an unnecessary use of chemicals and can potentially harm the plant or beneficial organisms.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of any chemical. For specific diagnosis or persistent issues, please feel free to bring a plant sample to the Department of Plant Pathology at HAU, Hisar, for expert analysis.
