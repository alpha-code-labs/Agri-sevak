As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide guidance on managing these physical damage issues in Hibiscus, keeping in mind the specific conditions in Haryana. It's important to note that while "leaf burning/melting" is a common physiological issue, "fruit bursting" and "hardness in fruit" are less frequently reported as significant problems in ornamental Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis). However, if you are referring to *Hibiscus sabdariffa* (Roselle), which is grown for its edible calyces, these issues can be more relevant.

Here's how to address these conditions:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Calyx Splitting/Cracking in Roselle)

This condition is more relevant for *Hibiscus sabdariffa* (Roselle) where the calyces are the harvested part. In ornamental Hibiscus, the true fruit (capsule) is generally not a concern for bursting.

**Causes:**
*   **Irregular Watering:** Sudden heavy irrigation or rainfall after a prolonged dry spell can lead to rapid water uptake, causing cells to expand quickly and burst the fruit/calyx skin.
*   **Calcium Deficiency:** Calcium is crucial for cell wall integrity. Its deficiency can weaken cell walls, making them prone to cracking.
*   **Rapid Growth:** Very rapid growth spurred by excessive nitrogen fertilization can also contribute to thinner, weaker fruit/calyx skin.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain a uniform soil moisture level, especially during fruit/calyx development. Avoid extreme fluctuations between dry and wet conditions.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch around the base of the plants to help retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate calcium availability in the soil. Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient levels.
*   **Calcium Application:** If calcium deficiency is suspected or confirmed by soil test:
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5 g/L of water, or **Calcium chloride** at 3-4 g/L of water, every 10-15 days during the fruit/calyx development stage.
    *   **Soil Application:** Incorporate **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate dihydrate)** into the soil at 250-500 kg/acre, depending on soil test recommendations, especially in sodic or calcium-deficient soils.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

This is a common physiological disorder, especially in the hot and often dry conditions of Haryana.

**Causes:**
*   **Sun Scorch/Heat Stress:** Intense direct sunlight and high temperatures, particularly during summer, can cause leaf tissue to burn, turn brown, and become crispy.
*   **Water Stress (Drought):** Insufficient water supply leads to desiccation of leaf tissues.
*   **Water Stress (Overwatering/Waterlogging):** While seemingly contradictory, waterlogging can damage roots, impairing their ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to symptoms similar to drought stress (leaf burn).
*   **Salinity:** High salt concentration in the soil or irrigation water can cause marginal leaf burn.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance/Toxicity:** Excess of certain nutrients (e.g., boron) or severe deficiency of others (e.g., potassium) can cause leaf scorch.
*   **Chemical Burn:** Improper application of fertilizers (too high concentration) or pesticides can cause phytotoxicity, leading to leaf burning or "melting" (rapid tissue breakdown).

**Control Measures:**
*   **Provide Partial Shade:** During peak summer months (April-June), provide partial shade, especially during the hottest part of the day (11 AM - 4 PM). Shade nets (30-50%) can be very effective.
*   **Adequate and Consistent Irrigation:** Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry periods. Check soil moisture before watering. Avoid both drought and waterlogging.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips) around the base of the plant to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce weed competition.
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify nutrient deficiencies or toxicities and salinity issues.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to heat stress.
*   **Salinity Management:** If salinity is an issue, use good quality irrigation water. For soil salinity, incorporate **Gypsum (Calcium sulphate dihydrate)** as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Proper Chemical Application:** Always follow label instructions for fertilizers and pesticides. Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day or when plants are stressed.
*   **Foliar Sprays for Stress Recovery:**
    *   To help plants recover from stress, a foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** at 5 g/L or **Magnesium sulphate** at 2-3 g/L can be beneficial.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Calyx in Roselle)

This condition is primarily relevant for *Hibiscus sabdariffa* (Roselle) where tender calyces are desired for consumption. In ornamental Hibiscus, the capsule is naturally hard when mature.

**Causes:**
*   **Over-maturity:** The most common reason. Calyces become fibrous and hard if harvested too late.
*   **Environmental Stress:** Prolonged drought or very high temperatures can lead to tougher, less succulent calyces.
*   **Nutrient Imbalance:** While not a direct cause, overall poor plant health due to nutrient deficiencies can affect fruit/calyx quality.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest Roselle calyces when they are still tender and succulent, typically 10-15 days after the flower opens, before they become too fibrous. The exact timing depends on the variety and environmental conditions.
*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent water supply, especially during the calyx development stage, to promote succulence.
*   **Mulching:** Helps maintain soil moisture and moderate soil temperature, contributing to better calyx quality.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide a balanced fertilizer program based on soil test results to support overall plant health and development. No specific chemical is used to "soften" hard calyces; prevention through good cultural practices is key.
