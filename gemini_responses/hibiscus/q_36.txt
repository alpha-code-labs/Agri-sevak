As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand that 'Hibiscus' can refer to several species. Given your query about 'Yield, Fruit quality, and Storage life,' I will provide scientifically verified advice primarily for *Hibiscus sabdariffa* (Roselle), which is cultivated for its edible calyces (often referred to as 'fruits'). If you are referring to ornamental Hibiscus species, please clarify, as 'fruit quality' and 'storage life' are not typically relevant for them in an agricultural context.

Here's how to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for *Hibiscus sabdariffa* in Haryana:

### I. Improving Yield

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding varieties adapted to Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Consult with local agricultural extension services for recommended varieties.
2.  **Soil and Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Soil Type:** Roselle thrives in well-drained sandy loam to loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0-7.0.
    *   **Basal Application (per acre):**
        *   Farm Yard Manure (FYM): 10-15 tonnes, incorporated into the soil during land preparation.
        *   Nitrogen (N): 40-60 kg (e.g., through **Urea**).
        *   Phosphorus (P2O5): 20-30 kg (e.g., through **Single Super Phosphate**).
        *   Potassium (K2O): 20-30 kg (e.g., through **Muriate of Potash**).
    *   **Top Dressing:** Apply the remaining 20-30 kg N (from **Urea**) 30-45 days after sowing.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply **Zinc Sulphate** (10 kg/acre) as a soil application, or foliar spray **Zinc EDTA** (0.5 g/L) and **Borax** (1 g/L) during vegetative growth.
3.  **Water Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate and consistent moisture, especially during flowering and calyx development.
    *   Irrigate as needed, particularly during dry spells, but avoid waterlogging.
4.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weed control is crucial during the initial 30-45 days after sowing to prevent competition.
    *   Manual weeding is effective.
    *   For chemical control, a pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin** (1.0-1.5 kg a.i./acre) within 3 days of sowing can be used.
5.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Pests:**
        *   **Aphids, Mealybugs:** For sucking pests, spray with **Imidacloprid** (0.2-0.3 ml/L) or **Thiamethoxam** (0.2 g/L).
        *   **Fruit Borers:** For fruit borers, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml/L) or **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g/L).
    *   **Diseases:**
        *   **Powdery Mildew:** Spray with **Sulphur** (wettable powder, 2 g/L) or **Hexaconazole** (0.5 ml/L).
        *   **Leaf Spot:** Spray with **Mancozeb** (2 g/L) or **Carbendazim** (1 g/L).
        *   **Stem Rot:** Improve drainage, ensure proper plant spacing, and use resistant varieties.
6.  **Planting Density:**
    *   Maintain optimal plant spacing (e.g., 60 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants) to allow for proper growth, light penetration, and air circulation, which contributes to higher yields.

### II. Improving Fruit (Calyx) Quality

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Adequate and balanced application of NPK and micronutrients, especially Potassium, is vital for developing large, firm, and well-colored calyces.
2.  **Consistent Water Supply:**
    *   Consistent moisture during calyx development prevents shriveling and ensures good size and succulence.
3.  **Effective Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Protecting plants from pests and diseases prevents blemishes, deformities, and premature dropping of calyces, ensuring a high-quality harvest.
4.  **Timely Harvest:**
    *   Harvest calyces when they are fully developed, plump, and have achieved their characteristic deep red color, but before they become overly fibrous or start to dry on the plant. Over-mature calyces can be tough and less desirable.
5.  **Adequate Sunlight:**
    *   Sufficient sunlight exposure is crucial for the development of vibrant color (anthocyanins) in the calyces.

### III. Improving Storage Life

1.  **Optimal Harvesting Maturity:**
    *   Harvest calyces at the peak of maturity (fully developed, firm, and deep red). Immature or over-mature calyces have significantly shorter storage lives.
2.  **Gentle Harvesting and Handling:**
    *   Harvest manually and handle calyces gently to avoid physical damage (bruises, cuts), which can accelerate spoilage and microbial growth.
3.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Immediately after harvest, remove field heat by placing calyces in a cool, shaded area. Rapid cooling helps slow down respiration and metabolic processes, extending shelf life.
4.  **Cleaning and Sorting:**
    *   Remove any dirt, debris, or damaged/diseased calyces before storage. Avoid washing fresh calyces if they are to be stored, as added moisture can promote fungal growth.
5.  **Appropriate Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store fresh calyces at low temperatures, ideally between 5-10°C.
    *   **Humidity:** Maintain a high relative humidity (85-90%) to prevent moisture loss and wilting.
    *   **Packaging:** Pack in perforated plastic bags or containers. Perforations allow for some ventilation while helping to maintain high humidity around the calyces.
6.  **Drying for Long-Term Storage:**
    *   For very long-term preservation, drying is the most effective method.
    *   Dry calyces in the sun or using mechanical dryers until their moisture content is below 10-12%.
    *   Store dried calyces in airtight containers in a cool, dry, and dark place to prevent re-absorption of moisture and degradation.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly enhance the yield, quality, and storage life of your Hibiscus (Roselle) crop in Haryana.
