As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for transplanting Hibiscus in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most favourable times for transplanting Hibiscus in Haryana are:

*   **Early Spring (February to March):** This period allows the plant to establish its root system before the onset of intense summer heat. The moderate temperatures and increasing daylight hours promote healthy new growth.
*   **Post-Monsoon Autumn (September to October):** After the monsoon rains, the soil is moist, and temperatures begin to cool down, providing a conducive environment for root establishment before the cooler winter months.

Avoid transplanting during the peak summer (May-July) due to extreme heat and the peak winter (December-January) due to cold stress, as these conditions can severely hinder establishment and lead to plant mortality.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing for Hibiscus depends on whether you intend to grow them as individual specimen plants or as a hedge:

*   **For Individual Specimen Plants:** Allow a spacing of **1.5 to 2.5 meters** between plants. This provides ample room for the plant to grow to its full size, develop a robust root system, and ensure good air circulation, which helps prevent fungal diseases.
*   **For Hedges:** A closer spacing of **1.0 to 1.5 meters** can be used. This allows the plants to grow together and form a dense screen.

### Transplantation Process

Follow these steps for a successful Hibiscus transplantation:

1.  **Preparation of the New Site:**
    *   Choose a location that receives at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily.
    *   Dig a planting hole that is twice as wide as the root ball and of the same depth.
    *   Amend the excavated soil with well-rotted farmyard manure or compost (approximately 1 part organic matter to 3 parts soil) to improve fertility and drainage.
    *   Ensure the soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which Hibiscus dislikes.

2.  **Pre-Transplant Care:**
    *   Water the Hibiscus plant thoroughly in its original location 1-2 days before transplanting. This hydrates the plant and makes the soil around the roots easier to manage.

3.  **Excavating the Plant:**
    *   Carefully dig a wide circle around the base of the plant, ensuring you get as much of the root ball as possible. The larger the root ball, the less transplant shock the plant will experience.
    *   Use a sharp spade or shovel to cut through the roots cleanly.
    *   Gently lift the plant, supporting the root ball from underneath. If the root ball is large and fragile, you may wrap it in burlap to keep it intact during transport.

4.  **Planting in the New Hole:**
    *   Place the Hibiscus plant in the prepared hole, ensuring that the top of the root ball is level with the surrounding soil surface. Planting too deep can lead to stem rot.
    *   Backfill the hole with the amended soil, gently firming it around the root ball to remove any air pockets. Do not compact the soil excessively.
    *   Create a small soil berm or basin around the plant to help retain water.

5.  **Post-Transplant Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the plant thoroughly immediately after transplanting until the soil is saturated. This helps settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Pruning:** For larger plants, prune back about one-third of the foliage. This reduces the leaf surface area, minimizing water loss through transpiration and reducing stress on the newly disturbed root system.
    *   **Consistent Moisture:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged for the first few weeks after transplanting. Check the soil moisture daily.
    *   **Temporary Shade (if needed):** If transplanting during a slightly warmer period within the recommended windows, consider providing temporary shade for a few days to reduce transplant shock.
    *   **Avoid Fertilizing:** Do not apply chemical fertilizers immediately after transplanting. Wait until you see signs of new growth (typically 4-6 weeks) before applying a balanced, slow-release fertilizer.
