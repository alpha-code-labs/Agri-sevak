As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for seed and soil treatment for Hibiscus, keeping in mind the conditions in Haryana.

It is important to note that ornamental Hibiscus varieties are predominantly propagated through cuttings rather than seeds. Therefore, seed treatment is generally not a primary concern unless you are specifically dealing with seed propagation for breeding or specific species.

### Seed Treatment for Hibiscus (If seeds are used)

If you are propagating Hibiscus from seeds, a prophylactic seed treatment can help prevent damping-off and other seed-borne fungal diseases.

*   **Biological Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Trichoderma viride** at 4-6 grams per kilogram of seed. Mix the required quantity of bio-fungicide with a small amount of water to make a slurry, then coat the seeds evenly and dry them in shade before sowing.
*   **Chemical Treatment:**
    *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 1-2 grams per kilogram of seed. Mix the chemical with seeds thoroughly to ensure uniform coating.

### Soil Treatment for Hibiscus

Soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases (like root rot, wilt) and pests (nematodes, white grubs) that can affect Hibiscus plants, whether propagated from seeds or cuttings.

#### 1. For General Soil Health and Prevention of Fungal Diseases (Root Rot, Wilt)

*   **Biological Treatment (Recommended for sustainable management):**
    *   **Trichoderma viride:** Mix 2.5 kilograms of **Trichoderma viride** formulation with 50-100 kilograms of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. Keep the mixture moist and covered for 7-10 days in a shaded area before broadcasting it evenly over 1 acre of soil and incorporating it, or apply 5-10 grams per plant as a soil drench around the root zone. This should be done before planting or at the time of planting.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Similar to Trichoderma, mix 2.5 kilograms of **Pseudomonas fluorescens** formulation with 50-100 kilograms of FYM/compost and apply per acre, or 5-10 grams per plant as a soil drench.
*   **Chemical Treatment (For existing problems or high-risk areas):**
    *   **Carbendazim:** For root rot and wilt, drench the soil around the affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 grams per litre of water. Apply 500 ml to 1 litre of solution per plant, depending on its size and severity of the problem.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride:** For *Pythium* and *Phytophthora* induced root rots, drench the soil with **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 2-3 ml per litre of water.

#### 2. For Nematode Management (e.g., Root-Knot Nematodes)

*   **Biological Treatment (Preferred):**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*): Mix 2.5 kilograms of **Purpureocillium lilacinum** formulation with 50-100 kilograms of FYM/compost and apply per acre, or 5-10 grams per plant as a soil drench around the root zone. This bio-nematicide helps in suppressing nematode populations.
*   **Chemical Treatment (Use with caution and only if biological methods are insufficient):**
    *   This is not known to affect Hibiscus. (While some nematicides are CIBRC approved, their general recommendation for ornamental Hibiscus from an academic institution is often avoided due to toxicity and availability of safer alternatives. For specific severe infestations, a targeted recommendation might be considered after diagnosis, but for a general process, biological control is preferred).

#### 3. For Soil Insect Pests (e.g., White Grubs, Termites)

*   **Chemical Treatment:**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos:** For white grubs and termites, drench the soil around the plants with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2-4 ml per litre of water. Ensure the solution penetrates the root zone.
    *   **Fipronil:** For soil grubs, incorporate **Fipronil 0.3% GR** into the soil at a rate of 10-15 kilograms per acre before planting or as a top dressing around existing plants.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test to understand the specific nutrient deficiencies or excesses and the presence of pathogens/pests in your soil.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine these treatments with good cultural practices such as proper sanitation, adequate drainage, balanced nutrition, and regular monitoring for pests and diseases.
*   **Timing:** Apply soil treatments when the soil is moist but not waterlogged.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling chemicals and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines.
