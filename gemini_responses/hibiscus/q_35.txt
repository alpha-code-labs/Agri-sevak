As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Hibiscus, applicable to conditions in Haryana:

The specific maturity signs, harvesting time, and cutting process for Hibiscus depend on the intended use, as different species or parts of the plant are harvested for various purposes (e.g., ornamental flowers, calyces for food/drink, or fiber). Here, we will focus on the most common uses in horticulture and agriculture in Haryana: ornamental flowers (e.g., *Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*) and calyces (e.g., *Hibiscus sabdariffa* or Roselle).

### Maturity Signs

*   **For Ornamental Flowers (e.g., *Hibiscus rosa-sinensis*):**
    *   The flower bud shows full color and is just beginning to unfurl or is fully open. Hibiscus flowers are ephemeral, typically lasting only one day. For optimal display, they are considered mature when fully open and vibrant.
*   **For Calyces (e.g., *Hibiscus sabdariffa* - Roselle):**
    *   The calyces (the fleshy, enlarged sepals surrounding the seed pod) become plump, succulent, and develop their characteristic deep red color. This typically occurs 3-4 weeks after the flower has bloomed and withered. The seed pod inside should be firm but not fully dry.

### Harvesting Time

*   **For Ornamental Flowers:**
    *   Harvest early in the morning, after the dew has dried but before the intense heat of the day sets in. This ensures maximum turgidity and helps to extend the very short vase life of the cut flowers.
*   **For Calyces (Roselle):**
    *   Harvest when the calyces are fully developed, plump, and brightly colored, usually 3-4 weeks post-flowering. Multiple harvests can be made from the same plant as new calyces mature throughout the season.

### Cutting Process

*   **For Ornamental Flowers (Cut Flowers):**
    *   Use sharp, clean pruning shears or scissors to make a clean cut.
    *   Cut the stem at a 45-degree angle, approximately 15-20 cm long, just above a leaf node (where a leaf or branch emerges). This encourages new growth on the plant and provides a larger surface area for water absorption by the cut flower.
    *   Immediately place the cut stems into a bucket of water to prevent wilting. Remove any leaves that would fall below the waterline in the vase to prevent bacterial growth.
*   **For Calyces (Roselle):**
    *   Carefully detach the mature calyces from the stem using a sharp knife or secateurs. You can either cut the entire calyx with a short stem or gently twist it off.
    *   Ensure not to damage the main stem or any developing calyces, allowing for subsequent harvests from the same plant.
*   **General Pruning/Maintenance (for plant health and shape):**
    *   Use sharp, sterilized pruning shears.
    *   Remove any dead, diseased, or damaged branches by cutting back to healthy wood.
    *   Prune to maintain the desired plant shape and size, and to encourage bushier growth and more prolific flowering.
    *   For ornamental hibiscus, major pruning is often carried out in late winter or early spring before new growth begins, or after a major flush of flowering.
