Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Hibiscus.

Here's how to control the specified pests:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers are general feeders and can cause significant damage to Hibiscus leaves and flowers by chewing.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Mechanical Control:** For small infestations, hand-picking grasshoppers, especially nymphs, can be effective.
*   **Cultural Control:** Keep the area around Hibiscus plants free of tall weeds and debris, which can serve as breeding grounds and shelter for grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control:** In case of severe infestations, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides when grasshoppers are young and more susceptible.

    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm (Neem-based pesticide): 3-5 ml per litre of water (effective for early stages and as a repellent).

### 2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Hibiscus as a primary pest. The Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris) is predominantly a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, radish). While it might occasionally be found on other plants, it does not typically cause significant damage to Hibiscus. Therefore, specific control measures for Painted Bug on Hibiscus are generally not required. If you observe a few, they are likely incidental visitors.

### 3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

Red cotton bugs are polyphagous pests that can feed on various plants, including Hibiscus, which belongs to the Malvaceae family. They suck sap from leaves, flowers, and developing seeds, leading to wilting, deformation, and reduced plant vigour.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Mechanical Control:** Hand-picking and destroying adult bugs and nymphs can be effective for small infestations.
*   **Cultural Control:** Remove any fallen plant debris or weeds around the Hibiscus plants, as these can provide shelter for the bugs.
*   **Chemical Control:** For larger infestations, systemic or contact insecticides can be used.

    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 g per litre of water.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml per litre of water.

### 4. Black Ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of Hibiscus, meaning they do not feed on the plant itself. However, their presence on Hibiscus plants often indicates the presence of other sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. Ants "farm" these pests for the honeydew they excrete. Controlling the primary sap-sucking pests will usually lead to the disappearance of ants. If ants are a nuisance or are causing damage to roots (e.g., by building nests around the base), specific control might be needed.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Identify and Control Primary Pests:** Inspect your Hibiscus plants for aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. If found, control these pests using appropriate insecticides (e.g., **Imidacloprid**, **Acetamiprid**, or **Malathion** as mentioned above for sucking pests).
*   **Physical Barriers:** Apply sticky bands around the base of the stem to prevent ants from climbing up the plant.
*   **Direct Ant Control (if necessary):** If ants are nesting at the base of the plant or are a significant nuisance, you can use:

    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of the plant (avoid direct spray on foliage if possible).
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 10-15 kg per acre (or a small amount around the base of individual plants) as a soil application to control ant nests.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize effectiveness.
*   Avoid spraying during flowering if possible, or spray in the evening to protect pollinators.
*   For any specific local recommendations or severe infestations, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer.
