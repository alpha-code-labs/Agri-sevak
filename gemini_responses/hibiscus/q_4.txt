Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that wilt, including bacterial wilt (often referred to as Parawilt in some contexts, particularly when caused by *Ralstonia solanacearum*) and fungal wilts (*Fusarium oxysporum*, *Verticillium dahliae*), is a significant problem affecting Hibiscus plants in our region. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a scientifically verified strategy to control wilt in Hibiscus:

**Understanding the Problem:**
Wilt diseases cause the plant's vascular system to become blocked, preventing water and nutrients from reaching the leaves and stems, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death. Bacterial wilt (*Ralstonia solanacearum*) is particularly aggressive and can cause rapid wilting (Parawilt). Fungal wilts are also common and can be chronic.

**Integrated Disease Management (IDM) Strategy:**

**1. Cultural and Preventive Measures (Most Crucial):**
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available, choose Hibiscus varieties known for resistance to wilt diseases.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Immediately remove and destroy infected plants to prevent the spread of pathogens. Do not compost diseased plant material.
    *   Sterilize pruning tools and equipment with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol after working on infected plants.
*   **Soil Management:**
    *   Ensure excellent soil drainage. Waterlogging creates anaerobic conditions favorable for many wilt pathogens.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed organic matter (e.g., farmyard manure, compost) to improve soil structure and microbial activity, which can suppress pathogens.
    *   Maintain appropriate soil pH (generally 6.0-7.0 for Hibiscus).
    *   Avoid planting Hibiscus in areas where wilt-susceptible crops have recently been grown.
*   **Watering Practices:** Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting foliage, and ensure proper irrigation to prevent both drought stress and overwatering.
*   **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during weeding or cultivation to avoid damaging roots, as wounds provide entry points for pathogens.
*   **Soil Solarization:** For new beds or before planting, cover moist soil with clear plastic sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to kill soil-borne pathogens.

**2. Biological Control:**
These agents can be applied as a soil drench or mixed into the potting medium to suppress pathogens.
*   **For Fungal and Bacterial Wilts:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply as a soil drench at 5-10 g/L of water, or mix 2-4 kg/acre into the soil before planting. These fungi colonize roots and compete with pathogens.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens**: Apply as a soil drench at 5-10 g/L of water, or mix 2-4 kg/acre into the soil. This bacterium produces antimicrobial compounds and promotes plant growth.

**3. Chemical Control (Use as a last resort and in conjunction with IDM):**
Chemical control for established wilt is challenging, especially for bacterial wilt. These are primarily suppressive and preventive.

*   **For Fungal Wilts (e.g., Fusarium, Verticillium):**
    *   **Carbendazim**: Apply as a soil drench at 1-2 g/L of water around the base of the affected plant. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl**: Apply as a soil drench at 1-2 g/L of water around the base of the affected plant. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.

*   **For Bacterial Wilts (e.g., Ralstonia solanacearum - Parawilt):**
    *   Chemical control is less effective once the disease is established. However, copper-based compounds can offer some suppressive action and are often used preventively or at early stages.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride**: Apply as a soil drench at 2-3 g/L of water around the base of the plant. This can help reduce bacterial populations in the soil.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate chemical classes to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Early detection and intervention are key to managing wilt diseases effectively.

By implementing these integrated strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of wilt diseases in your Hibiscus plants. For specific local recommendations or severe outbreaks, please consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar.
