As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig Blight, and Tikka disease in Hibiscus, specifically for conditions in Haryana.

### Control of Dieback and Twig Blight in Hibiscus

Dieback and Twig Blight are common issues in Hibiscus, often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*, *Phomopsis*, *Colletotrichum*) or exacerbated by environmental stress, improper pruning, or insect damage. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and, if necessary, chemical control.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Pruning:**
    *   Immediately remove all affected branches and twigs. Cut well into healthy wood, at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms, to ensure all infected tissue is removed.
    *   Make clean cuts at an angle to facilitate water runoff and prevent pooling.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or rubbing alcohol between each cut and between plants to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Collect and destroy all pruned material (burn or bury deeply) to eliminate sources of inoculum.
*   **Improve Plant Vigor:**
    *   Ensure proper watering, especially during dry periods, to avoid water stress.
    *   Provide balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations to promote strong, healthy growth.
    *   Ensure good air circulation around the plant by proper spacing and selective pruning of dense growth. Avoid overhead irrigation if possible, as wet foliage can promote fungal growth.
*   **Wound Protection:**
    *   For larger pruning cuts, applying a fungicidal paste or Bordeaux mixture can help protect the wound from pathogen entry.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

If the problem is severe or persistent, fungicidal applications can be considered. It is advisable to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply fungicides as a thorough foliar spray, ensuring good coverage of the plant.

*   **For broad-spectrum protection and early stage control:**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water.
*   **For systemic action and curative control:**
    *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water.

Repeat applications every 10-15 days, especially during periods of high humidity or when new growth emerges, strictly following the manufacturer's label instructions for dosage and safety.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Hibiscus

*   This is not known to affect Hibiscus. Tikka disease is primarily a well-known leaf spot disease of groundnut (peanut), caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.
*   Hibiscus plants can suffer from various leaf spot diseases, but these are typically caused by different fungal pathogens (e.g., *Cercospora hibisci*, *Alternaria*, *Phyllosticta*) and are generally referred to as "leaf spot" rather than "Tikka disease."
*   If you are observing leaf spots on your Hibiscus, please provide more details or images for a specific diagnosis and tailored recommendation. General leaf spot management often involves similar cultural practices and fungicides as mentioned for Dieback and Twig Blight.
