Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Red Spider Mites and Rust Mites on your Hibiscus plants. These mites are common pests and can cause significant damage if not managed properly.

Here's an integrated approach for their control:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control (First Line of Defense):**

1.  **Regular Inspection:** Frequently inspect your Hibiscus plants, especially the undersides of leaves, for early signs of mites (fine webbing, tiny moving dots, bronzing/rusting of leaves).
2.  **Water Spray:** A strong jet of water can physically dislodge mites from the plant foliage. Do this early in the morning, focusing on the undersides of leaves. Repeat every few days if infestation is mild.
3.  **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, shoots, or branches to reduce mite populations.
4.  **Weed Management:** Keep the area around your Hibiscus plants free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for mites.
5.  **Maintain Plant Health:** Healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper watering, fertilization, and sunlight.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

When cultural methods are insufficient, chemical control becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites primarily reside. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

Here are some CIBRC-approved technical chemical names effective against both Red Spider Mites and Rust Mites, along with their recommended dosages for spray application:

*   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
    *   **Spiromesifen (22.9% SC):** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1 ml per litre** of water.
    *   **Fenpyroximate (5% SC):** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1 ml per litre** of water.
    *   **Propargite (57% EC):** Apply at a rate of **1 - 1.5 ml per litre** of water.
    *   **Abamectin (1.9% EC):** Apply at a rate of **0.5 ml per litre** of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur (80% WP):** This is particularly effective against Rust Mites and also helps control Red Spider Mites. Apply at a rate of **2 - 3 grams per litre** of water. Avoid spraying sulphur when temperatures are very high (above 30°C) as it can cause phytotoxicity.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Rotation:** To prevent mites from developing resistance, it is crucial to rotate between different acaricides with different modes of action. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Timing:** Apply acaricides when mite populations are building up, or at the first sign of infestation. Early morning or late evening is generally best to avoid high temperatures and protect beneficial insects.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure complete and thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of the leaves, where mites are most active.
*   **Repeat Application:** Mite eggs are often resistant to acaricides. A second application after 7-10 days may be necessary to target newly hatched mites and break their life cycle.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions, precautions, and safety guidelines provided on the product label. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) during mixing and spraying. Keep chemicals out of reach of children and pets.

By combining these cultural practices with judicious use of appropriate acaricides, you can effectively manage Red Spider Mites and Rust Mites on your Hibiscus plants.
