As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides for effective management of fungal diseases in Hibiscus.

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:

These practices are fundamental and should be implemented consistently to reduce disease incidence and severity:

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly inspect plants and promptly remove and destroy any infected leaves, stems, or flowers. Do not compost diseased plant material.
2.  **Air Circulation:** Ensure adequate spacing between Hibiscus plants. Prune dense foliage to improve air movement within the plant canopy, which helps reduce humidity and leaf wetness.
3.  **Watering Practices:** Water plants at the base in the morning hours. This allows the foliage to dry quickly, minimizing the period of leaf wetness that favors fungal spore germination. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially in the evening.
4.  **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide balanced fertilizers. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush, soft growth that is more susceptible to fungal infections.
5.  **Weed Control:** Keep the area around Hibiscus plants free of weeds, as they can harbor pathogens and restrict air circulation.

### Specific Control Measures for Fungal Diseases:

Here are the recommended control measures for the mentioned fungal diseases:

#### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria* species)

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by dark brown to black spots on leaves, often with concentric rings (target-like appearance).
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** Apply at 2 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum* species)

*   **Symptoms:** Irregularly shaped spots on leaves, stems, and flowers, often turning dark brown or black. Cankers may form on stems, leading to dieback. Pinkish spore masses may be visible in humid conditions.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect Hibiscus.

#### 4. Blight (General, including *Phytophthora*, *Botrytis*, *Rhizoctonia* blights)

*   **Symptoms:** Rapid browning, wilting, and death of plant parts (leaves, stems, flowers). Can lead to damping-off of seedlings or collapse of mature plants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For blights caused by Oomycetes (e.g., *Phytophthora*):
        *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
    *   For general fungal blights:
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 1 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 5. Brown Spot (Caused by various fungi like *Cercospora*, *Phyllosticta*)

*   **Symptoms:** Brown, often circular or irregular spots on leaves, which may enlarge and coalesce.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** Apply at 1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 6. Downy Mildew (Caused by Oomycetes like *Plasmopara* species)

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowish or pale spots on the upper surface of leaves, with a characteristic purplish-grey, fuzzy growth on the lower leaf surface, especially in humid conditions.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** Apply at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** Apply at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium* species)

*   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the surface of leaves, stems, and flower buds. Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and drop prematurely.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2-3 g/L of water.
    *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** Apply at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC:** Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water.

#### 8. Grey Mildew

*   This is not known to affect Hibiscus.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for proper dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in fungal populations.
*   Apply fungicides preventively during periods conducive to disease development or at the first sign of symptoms.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of all plant surfaces, especially the undersides of leaves.
