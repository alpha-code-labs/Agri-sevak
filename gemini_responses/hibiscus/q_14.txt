Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Hibiscus plants. Both these pests are common in our region and can significantly impact plant health.

Here's how you can manage them:

### 1. Control of Termites (Dimag)

Termites feed on the roots and the base of the stem, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant. You might observe mud channels on the stem base or hollowed-out roots.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Soil Drenching:** Apply an insecticide around the base of the plant and drench the soil thoroughly.
        *   Use **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water. Drench 1-2 litres of this solution per plant, depending on its size, ensuring the soil around the root zone is well saturated. For larger areas, apply 2-4 litres of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** per acre mixed with sufficient water for drenching.
    *   **Granular Application:**
        *   Alternatively, you can use **Fipronil 0.3% GR**. Apply 10-20 grams per plant, mixing it into the soil around the base. For larger areas, apply 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove any dead wood or plant debris from the vicinity of the Hibiscus plants, as these can attract termites.
    *   Avoid direct contact of wooden stakes or structures with the soil near the plants.
    *   Ensure good drainage to prevent excessive soil moisture, which can sometimes favor termite activity.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic swellings or galls (knots). This damages the root system, impairing water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, wilting, and reduced flowering.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Soil Drenching:**
        *   Use **Carbosulfan 25% EC** at a concentration of 2-3 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the root zone of the affected plants. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.
    *   **Granular Application:**
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** can also provide some control against nematodes. Apply 10-20 grams per plant, mixing it into the soil around the root zone. For larger areas, apply 10-15 kg per acre, incorporated into the soil.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Incorporate biological nematicides containing beneficial fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (now often referred to as *Purpureocillium lilacinum*) or *Trichoderma viride* into the soil.
        *   Apply 2-4 kg of the bio-nematicide formulation per acre, mixed with 100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, and apply to the soil. For individual plants, apply 10-20 grams mixed with compost around the root zone. These beneficial organisms parasitize nematode eggs and juveniles, or enhance plant resistance.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate plenty of well-decomposed organic matter (compost, FYM) into the soil. This improves soil health and can enhance the activity of beneficial microorganisms that suppress nematodes.
    *   **Solarization:** If you are preparing a new bed, solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months) can significantly reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** While difficult for perennial Hibiscus, in a garden setting, rotating annual plants with non-host crops can help reduce nematode build-up.

**Important Precautions:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions, safety precautions, and dosage recommendations provided on the product label of any chemical or biological pesticide.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection) while handling and applying chemicals.
*   Avoid applying chemicals during flowering to protect pollinators.
*   Keep chemicals out of reach of children and pets.
*   Store pesticides in their original containers in a cool, dry, and locked place.

By adopting an integrated approach combining cultural practices, biological agents, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Hibiscus plants.
