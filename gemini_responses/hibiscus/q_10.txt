Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Hibiscus plants in Haryana.

Here's how to control the mentioned pests:

### 1. Borers (Stem Borers)

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stems, leading to wilting and dieback of branches.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect your Hibiscus plants for signs of borer activity, such as sawdust-like frass, wilting branches, or entry/exit holes.
    *   Prune and destroy any infested branches immediately to prevent the spread of borers. Ensure the pruned material is disposed of properly (e.g., burning, deep burying) to kill the larvae inside.
    *   Maintain plant vigour through proper nutrition and watering, as healthy plants are more resilient.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For severe infestations, systemic insecticides can be effective. Apply as a drench around the base of the plant or as a foliar spray targeting the affected stems.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml to 0.4 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g to 0.25 g per litre of water)
    *   **Fipronil** (1.0 ml to 1.5 ml per litre of water) - can be used as a drench or spray.

### 2. Caterpillars (Defoliators/Leaf Feeders)

Various caterpillar species can feed on Hibiscus leaves and flowers, causing defoliation and damage to buds.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and hand-pick caterpillars from the leaves and destroy them, especially for small infestations.
    *   Remove and destroy any webs or rolled leaves where caterpillars might be hiding.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki** (Bt) (1.0 g to 2.0 g per litre of water) - This biological insecticide is effective against young caterpillars and is safe for beneficial insects.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For widespread infestations, contact or systemic insecticides can be used.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml to 0.4 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g to 0.25 g per litre of water)
    *   **Flubendiamide** (0.2 ml to 0.3 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Indoxacarb** (0.5 ml to 0.75 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (0.5 ml to 1.0 ml per litre of water)

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Hibiscus. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

Leaf folders cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within the protective fold, leading to reduced photosynthesis and aesthetic damage.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and manually remove and destroy any folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   Maintain good garden hygiene to reduce potential breeding sites.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Targeted application of insecticides is necessary to reach the larvae inside the folded leaves.
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (0.3 ml to 0.4 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (0.2 g to 0.25 g per litre of water)
    *   **Flubendiamide** (0.2 ml to 0.3 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Indoxacarb** (0.5 ml to 0.75 ml per litre of water)
    *   **Quinalphos** (1.5 ml to 2.0 ml per litre of water)

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Always read the product label carefully** for specific dosage, safety precautions, pre-harvest intervals (if applicable for edible parts, though Hibiscus is ornamental), and application instructions.
*   **Rotate insecticides** with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.
*   Apply insecticides during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy, and to protect pollinators if the plant is flowering.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stems where pests often hide.
*   Consider an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
