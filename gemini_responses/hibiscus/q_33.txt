As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Hibiscus in Haryana:

Controlling weeds in ornamental plants like Hibiscus requires careful consideration to avoid damage to the desirable plant. Manual methods and cultural practices are often preferred, with chemical control used judiciously and with strict adherence to safety guidelines.

**General Weed Management Principles for Hibiscus:**

1.  **Manual Weeding:** This is the safest and most effective method for small areas or individual plants. Regularly remove weeds by hand, especially when they are young, to prevent seed production and competition.
2.  **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, wood chips, compost) around the base of Hibiscus plants. This suppresses weed germination, conserves soil moisture, and moderates soil temperature.
3.  **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate spacing between Hibiscus plants to reduce competition and allow for easier manual weeding.
4.  **Clean Planting Material:** Use weed-free soil and planting material to prevent the introduction of weed seeds.

**Specific Weed Control Measures:**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (general):**

*   **Manual Removal:** Regularly hand-pull or hoe out these weeds, especially before they flower and set seed.
*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** These herbicides are applied to the soil before weeds emerge to prevent their germination. They are generally safer for established Hibiscus plants as long as they are applied correctly and do not come into contact with foliage.
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply as a pre-emergence herbicide to the soil surface.
        *   **Dosage:** 3.3 - 5.0 Litres per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For smaller areas, approximately 16.5 - 25 ml per Litre of water, applied evenly to the soil surface.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply as a pre-emergence herbicide to the soil surface.
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0 Litre per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For smaller areas, approximately 5 ml per Litre of water, applied evenly to the soil surface.
*   **Post-emergence (Directed Spray) Herbicides:** These are non-selective and will damage Hibiscus if they come into contact with the plant. Use only as a directed spray to target weeds, avoiding any contact with Hibiscus foliage, stems, or roots.
    *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:** Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 5.0 Litres per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For spot treatment, approximately 10 - 20 ml per Litre of water.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:** Apply as a directed spray to actively growing weeds.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.0 - 4.0 Litres per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For spot treatment, approximately 8 - 16 ml per Litre of water.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**

Amarbail is a parasitic weed that can severely damage Hibiscus.

*   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. As soon as Amarbail is observed, manually remove it by hand. If it has already attached to the Hibiscus, carefully cut off the affected parts of the Hibiscus branch to ensure complete removal of the parasite. Dispose of the removed Amarbail away from the garden to prevent re-infestation.
*   **Prevention:** Ensure that any new planting material or soil brought into the garden is free from Amarbail seeds or plant fragments.
*   **Chemical Control (Extreme Caution):** Chemical control is very difficult without harming the host plant.
    *   **Diquat dibromide 20% SL:** Can be used as a *highly directed spot spray* directly onto the Amarbail strands, taking extreme care to avoid any contact with the Hibiscus plant. This is a contact herbicide and will cause severe damage to Hibiscus if it touches.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 5.0 Litres per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For spot treatment, approximately 12.5 - 25 ml per Litre of water.

**3. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

This is not known to affect Hibiscus. Orobanche species are primarily parasitic on field crops like mustard, tomato, brinjal, and tobacco, and are not typically found on ornamental shrubs like Hibiscus.

**4. Phalaris minor (Gulli Danda) and other Grassy Weeds:**

*   **Manual Removal:** Hand-pulling or hoeing is effective, especially when weeds are young.
*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:** As mentioned above, **Pendimethalin 30% EC** and **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC** can provide some control of germinating grassy weeds.
*   **Post-emergence (Selective Graminicides):** These herbicides specifically target grassy weeds and are generally safer for broadleaf plants like Hibiscus, but always test on a small area first if unsure.
    *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC:** Apply to actively growing grassy weeds.
        *   **Dosage:** 1.0 - 2.0 Litres per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For smaller areas, approximately 5 - 10 ml per Litre of water.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC:** Apply to actively growing grassy weeds.
        *   **Dosage:** 0.5 - 0.75 Litres per acre (in 200-300 Litres of water). For smaller areas, approximately 2.5 - 3.75 ml per Litre of water.

**Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Read the Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the herbicide label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and re-entry intervals.
*   **Protective Gear:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, mask, eye protection, long-sleeved clothing) during mixing and application.
*   **Timing:** Apply herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results. Pre-emergence herbicides must be applied before weed seeds germinate.
*   **Avoid Drift:** Be extremely careful to avoid herbicide drift onto non-target plants, especially when using non-selective herbicides like Glyphosate or Paraquat dichloride. Use a spray shield if necessary.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture before applying pre-emergence herbicides for better efficacy.
*   **Test Application:** If you are unsure about the safety of a particular herbicide on your Hibiscus variety, test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.
*   **Storage and Disposal:** Store herbicides safely away from children and pets, and dispose of empty containers according to local regulations.

For specific advice tailored to your local conditions and Hibiscus variety, it is always recommended to consult with the agricultural extension specialists at HAU, Hisar.
