As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend a systematic approach to address micronutrient deficiencies in Plum orchards. The first and most crucial step is always a comprehensive **soil test** and, if possible, a **leaf tissue analysis**. These analyses will accurately diagnose the specific deficiencies and their severity, allowing for targeted and efficient nutrient management.

Based on typical deficiencies observed in Haryana and general horticultural practices for plums, here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies:

---

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Foliar Application:** This is often the quickest way to correct micronutrient deficiencies, especially for mobile nutrients, as nutrients are absorbed directly by the leaves. Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to maximize absorption and prevent leaf scorching.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction, especially for less mobile nutrients or severe deficiencies. Incorporate into the soil around the tree's drip line.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always consider adding a non-ionic spreader/sticker to foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Soil pH:** Haryana soils are often alkaline, which can reduce the availability of certain micronutrients (e.g., Iron, Zinc, Manganese, Boron). Chelated forms (like EDTA) are generally more effective in alkaline soils for Iron and Zinc.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management in Plum:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Small, narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), rosetting of leaves at the shoot tips, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and reduced fruit size and yield.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, starting at bud break.
        *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).
        *   Alternatively, **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) at 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency or long-term management):** Apply once a year, preferably before monsoon or during dormancy.
        *   **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 100-200 g per mature tree, or 25-50 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn yellow or even white, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.
        *   **Ferrous sulphate** (19% Fe) at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).
        *   Alternatively, **Iron EDTA** (12% Fe) at 1-1.5 g/L of water (0.1-0.15% solution). Iron EDTA is more effective in alkaline soils.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency, especially in alkaline soils):**
        *   **Iron EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre or 50-100 g per mature tree, applied in the root zone.
        *   **Ferrous sulphate** at 200-500 g per mature tree, but its effectiveness is limited in high pH soils.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, stunted growth, cracking or corking of fruits, internal browning of fruit flesh, poor fruit set, and sometimes distorted or thickened leaves.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Apply before flowering and again after fruit set.
        *   **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-1.5 g/L of water (0.1-0.15% solution).
        *   Alternatively, **Borax** (11% B) at 2-3 g/L of water (0.2-0.3% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):** Apply once a year, during dormancy.
        *   **Borax** or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 50-100 g per mature tree, or 5-10 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated. *Caution: Boron can be toxic in excess, so apply precisely based on soil test.*

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** While less common as a primary deficiency in soil, it can manifest as soft fruits, reduced fruit firmness, internal breakdown, poor storage quality, and sometimes tip burn on young leaves or growing points.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Multiple sprays are often required, especially during fruit development.
        *   **Calcium nitrate** (19% Ca) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
        *   Alternatively, **Calcium chloride** (27% Ca) at 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (for long-term soil amendment):**
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium sulphate) at 200-400 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil, especially beneficial in sodic soils common in parts of Haryana.
        *   **Calcium nitrate** at 50-100 kg/acre, applied in split doses.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, with veins remaining green. Leaves may develop a reddish-purple tint and drop prematurely.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, targeting affected foliage.
        *   **Magnesium sulphate** (9.6% Mg) at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):**
        *   **Magnesium sulphate** at 100-200 g per mature tree, or 25-50 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often with a finer network of green veins. In severe cases, small necrotic (dead) spots may appear, and growth can be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals, targeting young foliage.
        *   **Manganese sulphate** (28-30% Mn) at 2.5-5 g/L of water (0.25-0.5% solution).
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):**
        *   **Manganese sulphate** at 50-100 g per mature tree, or 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated.
