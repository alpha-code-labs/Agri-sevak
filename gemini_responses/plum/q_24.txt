As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for plum transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time for Plum

Plum trees are best transplanted during their dormant period to minimize stress and maximize establishment success.
*   In Haryana, the ideal time for plum transplantation is from **late December to February**, before the onset of new growth and bud break. This allows the root system to establish before the tree requires significant energy for foliage development.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance for Plum

The optimal spacing for plum trees depends on the rootstock used, the vigor of the scion variety, and the chosen training system.
*   For standard rootstocks and vigorous varieties, a spacing of **5 meters (plant-to-plant) x 5 meters (row-to-row)** to **6 meters x 6 meters** is generally recommended.
*   For semi-dwarfing rootstocks or high-density planting systems, closer spacing such as **3 meters x 4 meters** or **4 meters x 4 meters** can be adopted, but this requires specific training and management practices.

### Ideal Transplantation Process for Plum

1.  **Site Selection and Preparation:**
    *   Choose a site that receives full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours daily.
    *   Ensure the soil is well-drained. Plum thrives in loamy soils with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5.
    *   Clear the area of weeds, rocks, and debris.

2.  **Pit Digging:**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at least 15-30 days before the actual planting date.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.

3.  **Pit Filling and Amendment:**
    *   Mix the topsoil with **20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM)** or high-quality compost.
    *   Additionally, incorporate **1 kg of Single Super Phosphate** into the mixture to provide phosphorus for root development.
    *   Refill the pits with this amended soil mixture, allowing it to settle naturally.

4.  **Sapling Preparation:**
    *   **Bare-root saplings:** Inspect the roots carefully. Prune any damaged, broken, or circling roots. Soak the roots in water for a few hours before planting to rehydrate them.
    *   **Polybag/Containerized saplings:** Carefully remove the sapling from its container, ensuring the root ball remains intact. Avoid disturbing the roots excessively.

5.  **Planting:**
    *   Dig a small hole in the center of the prepared pit, just large enough to accommodate the root system.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the hole, ensuring that the bud union (graft union) is positioned **10-15 cm above the final soil line**. This is crucial to prevent the scion from rooting.
    *   Spread the roots evenly in the hole.
    *   Backfill with the remaining amended soil, gently firming it around the roots with your hands or feet to remove any air pockets.

6.  **Watering:**
    *   Immediately after planting, water the sapling thoroughly until the soil is saturated. This helps settle the soil around the roots and provides initial moisture.

7.  **Staking (Recommended):**
    *   For young trees, especially in areas prone to strong winds, provide a sturdy stake to support the sapling. This prevents it from being dislodged or damaged during establishment.

8.  **Initial Pruning (Heading Back):**
    *   After planting, prune the main stem (leader) of the sapling by heading it back to a height of **75-90 cm** from the ground. This encourages the development of strong lateral branches and a well-structured framework.
    *   Remove any side branches that are below **45-50 cm** from the ground.
