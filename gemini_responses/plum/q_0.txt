As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Plum cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to implement an integrated disease management approach, combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions. Always consult the latest recommendations from HAU or your local agricultural extension office for specific product availability and updated guidelines.

Here's how to address the listed fungal diseases:

### General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management in Plum:

These practices are fundamental for reducing disease incidence across various fungal pathogens:

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all fallen leaves, twigs, and mummified (dried, diseased) fruits from around the trees. Prune out any diseased or dead branches.
*   **Pruning:** Ensure proper pruning to maintain an open canopy, which improves air circulation and light penetration, thereby reducing humidity within the tree and discouraging fungal growth.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds to reduce humidity and alternate host plants.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as wet foliage for extended periods promotes fungal spore germination and infection. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to the trees. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, succulent growth more susceptible to certain diseases.

### Specific Disease Control Measures:

#### 1. Alternaria (Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight)

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by small, dark brown spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, leading to premature defoliation. Can also affect fruit.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement general sanitation and pruning practices as mentioned above.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2 g/L water.
        *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water can be effective.

#### 2. Anthracnose (Colletotrichum)

*   **Symptoms:** Causes sunken, dark lesions on fruit, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions. Can also affect leaves and twigs.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Maintain good orchard hygiene, prune out infected branches, and ensure proper tree spacing for air circulation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L water.
        *   Systemic options include **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L water or **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
        *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water can also be used.

#### 3. Blast

*   This is not known to affect Plum as a fungal disease. Bacterial blast caused by *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *syringae* is a known issue, but it is bacterial, not fungal.

#### 4. Blight (Focusing on Brown Rot Blight caused by *Monilinia* species)

*   **Symptoms:** Causes blossom blight, twig blight, and fruit rot (brown rot). Infected flowers turn brown and shrivel, twigs die back, and fruit develops soft brown spots that rapidly expand and become covered with tan spores.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune out all blighted blossoms, twigs, and mummified fruits during dormancy and growing season. Ensure good air circulation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply fungicides at pink bud, full bloom, and petal fall stages.
        *   Use **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1 ml/L water.
        *   Alternatively, **Propiconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water or **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water can be effective.
        *   **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L water can also be used.

#### 5. Brown Spot

*   This is a general symptom rather than a specific fungal disease. Symptoms described as 'brown spot' on plum are often associated with diseases like Alternaria leaf spot or early stages of other fungal infections. Refer to the control measures for Alternaria for managing such symptoms.

#### 6. Downy Mildew

*   This is not known to affect Plum.

#### 7. Powdery Mildew (*Podosphaera clandestina*)

*   **Symptoms:** Appears as white, powdery patches on leaves, young shoots, and sometimes fruit. Infected leaves may curl or distort.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Prune out infected shoots and maintain good air circulation.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Wettable Sulphur** at 2-3 g/L water, especially effective in early stages and cooler weather. Avoid sulphur application during very hot weather.
        *   Systemic fungicides like **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.5 g/L water or **Hexaconazole** at 0.5-1 ml/L water are highly effective.
        *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1 ml/L water also provides control.

#### 8. Grey Mildew (Botrytis Grey Mold caused by *Botrytis cinerea*)

*   **Symptoms:** Characterized by a greyish-brown fuzzy mold on flowers, fruit (especially near wounds or in humid conditions), and sometimes leaves. Can cause blossom blight and fruit rot.
*   **Control:**
    *   **Cultural:** Implement strict sanitation, remove all plant debris, and ensure good air circulation. Avoid any injury to fruits during harvesting and handling.
    *   **Chemical:**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L water.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1 g/L water can be used.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Schedule:** Follow a preventive spray schedule, especially during critical growth stages (e.g., bud break, flowering, fruit development) and periods of high humidity or rainfall.
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the fruit for consumption.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow all label instructions when handling and applying pesticides.
