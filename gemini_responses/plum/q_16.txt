As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for plum cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations for mature bearing plum trees (typically 5-10 years old) and should ideally be adjusted based on a comprehensive soil test report from a recognized laboratory. Soil testing is crucial for precise nutrient management and to avoid over or under-fertilization.

**General Fertilizer Recommendations for Mature Bearing Plum Trees (5-10 years old) per year per tree:**

**A. Soil Application:**

The following recommendations provide the required Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P2O5), Potassium (K2O), and Sulphur (S). You can choose between using **DAP** or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** for your phosphorus and sulphur needs.

**Option 1: Using Urea, DAP, Muriate of Potash, and Elemental Sulphur**

*   **Urea:** 1.05 - 1.25 kg per tree
*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate):** 0.65 - 0.75 kg per tree
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash):** 1.0 - 1.2 kg per tree
*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):** 50 - 100 g per tree

**Option 2: Using Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash**
(This option provides Phosphorus and Sulphur through SSP)

*   **Urea:** 1.3 - 1.5 kg per tree
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 1.8 - 2.2 kg per tree
*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash):** 1.0 - 1.2 kg per tree

**B. Foliar Application (Supplementary):**

Nano fertilizers are excellent for supplementary nutrient supply, especially during critical growth stages, and are applied as foliar sprays.

*   **Nano-Urea:** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-3 sprays during active vegetative growth (e.g., after fruit set, and subsequent flushes).
*   **Nano-DAP:** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply 2 sprays, one before flowering and another after fruit set.

**C. NPK Complex Fertilizers:**

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):** While specific NPK grades (e.g., 12:32:16, 19:19:19) can be used, precise nutrient management is better achieved with individual fertilizers as listed above. If using complex NPK fertilizers, the dose should be determined strictly based on soil test recommendations to match the specific nutrient requirements of your plum trees.

**Application Timing:**

*   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply in 2-3 split doses.
    *   **First Dose (Half N, Full P, Full K, Full S):** Before flowering (January-February).
    *   **Second Dose (Remaining N):** After fruit set (March-April).
    *   A third dose of N can be applied after harvest if tree vigor is low.
*   **Phosphorus (P) & Potassium (K):** Apply the full dose along with the first dose of Nitrogen before flowering.
*   **Sulphur (S):** Apply along with Phosphorus and Potassium.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test every 2-3 years to determine the exact nutrient status of your orchard soil. This will help in tailoring the fertilizer application precisely.
*   **Tree Age:** For young, non-bearing trees, the fertilizer dose should be proportionally lower and gradually increased as the tree grows and starts bearing fruit.
*   **Variety and Yield:** High-yielding varieties or trees with heavy fruit loads may require slightly higher nutrient inputs.
*   **Method of Application:** Fertilizers should be broadcast evenly in the tree basin, away from the trunk, and incorporated into the soil, followed by irrigation.
