As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Plum orchards in Haryana. Effective management relies on timely identification and appropriate intervention.

It is crucial to implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, which includes regular monitoring, cultural practices, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemical insecticides when necessary. Always consult your local HAU extension specialist for precise timing and specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions.

Here are the control measures for common pests within these categories that affect Plum:

### 1. Sawflies (e.g., Plum Sawfly - *Hoplocampa minuta* / *H. flava*)

Plum Sawfly is a significant pest. The larvae bore into young fruitlets shortly after petal fall, causing them to drop prematurely.

*   **Damage:** Small holes in young fruitlets, often with frass, leading to premature fruit drop.
*   **Timing of Control:** The most critical time for control is at petal fall, when adult sawflies are active and laying eggs, or when the first larvae hatch and begin to bore into fruitlets.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 0.2 g/L of water.

### 2. Weevils (e.g., various Fruit Weevils, similar to Plum Curculio)

While the classic Plum Curculio (*Conotrachelus nenuphar*) is more prevalent in temperate regions, various fruit weevil species can affect plums in India, causing similar damage.

*   **Damage:** Adults feed on young fruit, creating crescent-shaped scars where eggs are laid. Larvae develop inside the fruit, causing internal damage, deformities, and premature fruit drop.
*   **Timing of Control:** Apply insecticides from petal fall onwards, especially if damage or adult weevils are observed.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 0.3 ml/L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.

### 3. Beetles (e.g., Defoliating Beetles, Chafer Beetles/White Grubs)

This category includes various beetles. Adults of some species may feed on plum foliage or fruit, while the larval stage of chafer beetles (known as white grubs) can be a serious root pest.

*   **Damage:**
    *   **Adult Beetles:** Irregular holes or notches on leaves, sometimes feeding on fruit surface.
    *   **White Grubs (larvae of Chafer Beetles):** Feed on roots, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and in severe cases, tree death.
*   **Timing of Control:**
    *   **For adult beetles (foliar feeders):** Apply when significant defoliation or fruit damage is observed.
    *   **For white grubs (root feeders):** Soil application is done before planting or during the active feeding period of grubs, typically during monsoon.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For adult beetles (foliar application):**
        *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 2 ml/L of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **For white grubs (soil application, if identified as a problem):**
        *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 20-25 kg/acre, applied to the soil around the base of the trees and lightly incorporated, followed by irrigation.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval for any insecticide used to ensure fruit safety.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of the foliage and fruit for effective control.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides. Follow all label instructions carefully.
*   **Cultural Practices:** Good orchard sanitation, including the collection and destruction of fallen fruit (especially for sawflies and weevils), can significantly reduce pest populations.
