Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise you on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in your plum orchards. It is crucial to conduct a soil test before applying any fertilizers to get precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions. The dosages provided below are general guidelines for mature bearing plum trees and should be adjusted based on soil test results and tree age/yield.

### General Approach

The most effective way to address macro-nutrient deficiencies is through soil application, as it provides a sustained supply of nutrients to the tree. Foliar sprays can offer a quick, temporary boost, especially for nitrogen.

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   General yellowing of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins.
*   Stunted growth of shoots and reduced leaf size.
*   Poor fruit set and smaller fruit size.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 1.0 - 1.5 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per mature plum tree per year.
    *   Split this dose into 2-3 applications:
        *   First application: Before flowering (February-March).
        *   Second application: After fruit set (April-May).
        *   Optional third application: Post-harvest (June-July) for vigorous growth.
    *   Apply the fertilizer in a ring around the tree canopy, about 30-60 cm away from the trunk, and incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
    *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g of **Urea** per litre of water).
    *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals, avoiding flowering time to prevent flower drop.
    *   Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Leaves may turn dull green, purplish, or bronze, especially on the underside.
*   Stunted root development and overall plant growth.
*   Delayed flowering and fruit maturity.
*   Reduced fruit quality and yield.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 0.5 - 0.75 kg of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per mature plum tree per year.
    *   Alternatively, apply 1.5 - 2.0 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per mature plum tree per year.
    *   Apply the entire dose once a year, preferably before flowering (February-March), by incorporating it into the soil around the tree canopy, followed by irrigation.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

**Symptoms:**
*   Scorching or browning of leaf margins (edges), particularly on older leaves, giving a "burnt" appearance.
*   Weak stems and poor fruit development.
*   Reduced fruit size, poor colour, and lower sugar content.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and pests.

**Correction:**

*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply 0.8 - 1.2 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O) per mature plum tree per year.
    *   Alternatively, you can use **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O) at a slightly higher dose (1.0 - 1.5 kg per tree) if sulphur is also deficient or chloride sensitivity is a concern.
    *   Split this dose into 2 applications:
        *   First application: Before flowering (February-March).
        *   Second application: During fruit development (April-May).
    *   Apply the fertilizer in a ring around the tree canopy and incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a comprehensive soil test to accurately determine the nutrient status of your orchard and get precise recommendations. HAU, Hisar, provides soil testing facilities.
*   **Timing:** The timing of fertilizer application is crucial for optimal nutrient uptake and utilization by the plum trees.
*   **Method of Application:** Ensure fertilizers are applied uniformly and incorporated into the soil to minimize losses and maximize availability to the roots.
*   **Irrigation:** Always irrigate immediately after soil application of fertilizers to help dissolve the nutrients and move them into the root zone.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, vermicompost) and bio-fertilizers to improve soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
