As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Plum:

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust), and White Rust:** These specific rust diseases are primarily known to affect cereal crops (like wheat, barley, oats) or other specific plant families (e.g., *Albugo* on crucifers for White Rust). **These are not known to affect Plum.**

*   **Red Rust (Plum Rust):** This is the primary rust disease affecting plum trees, caused by the fungus *Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae* (also known as *Tranzschelia discolor*). It is a common issue in plum orchards, especially during warm, humid conditions.

**Control Measures for Red Rust (Plum Rust) caused by *Tranzschelia pruni-spinosae*:**

**Symptoms:**
Initial symptoms appear as small, angular, yellow spots on the upper surface of leaves. These spots later turn reddish-brown on the underside of the leaves, developing powdery pustules (uredinia). Severe infection leads to premature defoliation, weakening the tree and affecting fruit quality and yield.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all fallen infected leaves during autumn and winter. This helps reduce the overwintering inoculum.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper tree spacing and prune trees to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce leaf wetness and fungal development.
    *   **Nutrition:** Maintain balanced tree nutrition to enhance tree vigor and resistance.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    Fungicides are effective in managing plum rust, especially when applied preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. Always follow label instructions for dosage, application timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

    *   **Timing of Application:**
        *   First spray: Initiate spraying when the first symptoms appear, typically from late spring to early summer (May-June in Haryana), especially if weather conditions are conducive (warm and humid).
        *   Subsequent sprays: Repeat applications every 10-14 days, particularly during periods of high humidity or if disease pressure persists.

    *   **CIBRC Approved Fungicides for Plum Rust:**
        *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** Apply at 0.4-0.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** Apply at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** Apply at 2-2.5 g/L of water (as a protectant, especially in early stages or for resistance management).
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** Apply at 2-3 g/L of water (as a protectant, especially in early stages).

    **Note:** It is advisable to rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of the leaves.
