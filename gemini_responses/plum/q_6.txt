As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Plum in Haryana:

It is crucial to understand that there is no chemical cure for viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management strategies primarily focus on prevention, controlling insect vectors, and removing infected plants to prevent further spread.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Plum.
*   **Yellow vein clearing:** This is not known to affect Plum as a distinct viral disease.
*   **Stripe:** This is not known to affect Plum as a distinct viral disease.
*   **Stunt virus:** This is not known to affect Plum as a distinct viral disease.

For general viral diseases in Plum, including those causing symptoms like **Leaf curl** (viral origin) and **Mosaic**, the following integrated management strategies are recommended:

1.  **Use Certified Virus-Free Planting Material:** This is the most critical preventive measure. Always procure plum saplings from reputable nurseries that provide certified virus-free stock.
2.  **Vector Control:** Many plum viruses are transmitted by insect vectors, primarily aphids, leafhoppers, and thrips. Controlling these vectors can significantly reduce the spread of viral diseases.
    *   **For Aphids:**
        *   Spray with **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   **For Leafhoppers and Thrips:**
        *   Spray with **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Apply sprays during periods of active vector population, typically during new flush growth. Repeat applications as necessary, strictly adhering to the recommended pre-harvest intervals.
3.  **Rogueing of Infected Plants:** Immediately remove and destroy (by burning or deep burying) any plants showing clear symptoms of viral infection (e.g., severe mosaic patterns, leaf distortion, stunting, or unusual discoloration). This prevents the virus from spreading to healthy plants.
4.  **Weed Management:** Keep the plum orchard free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors, providing a reservoir for infection.
5.  **Sanitation:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or 70% alcohol between trees to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses, especially when working with multiple trees.
