As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and Boron in Plum cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to apply growth regulators and micronutrients at the correct stage and concentration, as improper use can lead to adverse effects. Always ensure thorough coverage and follow safety precautions.

### 1. Ethephon (Ethrel)

**Purpose:** Fruit thinning and hastening fruit maturity/improving color.

*   **For Fruit Thinning:**
    *   **Chemical:** **Ethephon** (e.g., 48% SL formulation)
    *   **Dose:** 100-150 ppm (0.2-0.3 ml of 48% SL per litre of water).
    *   **Application Time:** Apply at full bloom or within 7-10 days after full bloom, when fruitlets are very small.
    *   **Note:** Effectiveness can vary with cultivar, temperature, and tree vigor. Test on a small area first.

*   **For Hastening Maturity and Improving Color:**
    *   **Chemical:** **Ethephon** (e.g., 48% SL formulation)
    *   **Dose:** 250-500 ppm (0.5-1.0 ml of 48% SL per litre of water).
    *   **Application Time:** Apply when fruits begin to show color break (early ripening stage), typically 7-14 days before anticipated harvest.
    *   **Note:** Can lead to softer fruit if applied too late or at high concentrations.

### 2. 2,4-D

This is not commonly recommended as a growth regulator for Plum in Haryana. While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, its use in plum as a growth regulator (e.g., for fruit drop prevention) is generally not advised due to its very narrow safety margin and high potential for phytotoxicity (damage to the plant) at concentrations slightly above the desired effect. For fruit drop prevention in stone fruits, other auxins like Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA) are generally preferred and safer.

### 3. Boron

**Purpose:** Essential micronutrient for pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Prevents 'internal cork' or 'corky spot' in fruits.

*   **For Foliar Application:**
    *   **Chemical:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, containing approx. 10.5% Boron)
    *   **Dose:** 1-2 g per litre of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
    *   **Application Time:**
        *   First spray: Before flowering (at bud swell stage).
        *   Second spray: After fruit set (when fruits are pea-sized).
        *   A third spray can be given 4-6 weeks later if deficiency symptoms persist or soil analysis indicates low Boron.

    *   **Chemical:** **Boric Acid** (Orthoboric acid, containing approx. 17% Boron)
    *   **Dose:** 1 g per litre of water (0.1% solution).
    *   **Application Time:** Same as for Borax.

*   **For Soil Application (if severe deficiency):**
    *   **Chemical:** **Borax**
    *   **Dose:** 10-20 kg per acre, depending on soil test results and tree age/size.
    *   **Application Time:** Apply uniformly around the tree base during dormant season or early spring.
    *   **Note:** Soil application should be based on soil test recommendations, as excessive Boron can be toxic. Foliar sprays are generally preferred for quick correction and safer application.
