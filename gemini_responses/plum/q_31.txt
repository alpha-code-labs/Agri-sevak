As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by physical damage to plum crops. Here's scientifically verified advice for controlling the issues you've mentioned, keeping in mind the conditions prevalent in Haryana:

### Control of Physical Damage in Plum

**1. Fruit Bursting (Cracking)**

Fruit bursting is primarily a physiological disorder caused by rapid water uptake following a dry spell, leading to internal pressure exceeding the fruit's skin elasticity. Nutrient deficiencies, particularly calcium and boron, can also contribute by weakening cell walls.

*   **Water Management:** Maintain consistent soil moisture levels throughout the fruit development period. Avoid sudden heavy irrigation after prolonged dry periods. Use drip irrigation for precise water delivery and to minimize fluctuations.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the trees to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce moisture fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Calcium:** Calcium strengthens cell walls and improves skin elasticity. Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 0.5% (5 g/L of water) as a foliar spray, starting from fruit set and repeating every 10-15 days, 2-3 times, especially during rapid fruit growth.
    *   **Boron:** Boron is essential for cell wall integrity and calcium uptake. Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (Borax) at 0.1% (1 g/L of water) as a foliar spray during pre-bloom and early fruit development stages.

**2. Leaf Burning/Melting**

This condition is typically a result of heat stress, sunburn, or severe water stress, especially during the hot summer months in Haryana. "Melting" indicates severe tissue damage due to extreme heat.

*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate and consistent irrigation, especially during peak summer temperatures, to prevent water stress which exacerbates heat damage. Irrigate deeply in the morning or late evening to allow for maximum absorption and reduce evaporative losses.
*   **Shade Management:** Consider providing temporary partial shade using shade nets (e.g., 30-50% shade) during the hottest parts of the day in peak summer, especially for young trees or highly susceptible varieties.
*   **Nutrient Management:** A balanced nutrient program helps plants build resilience to stress. Ensure adequate potassium, which plays a crucial role in water regulation and heat tolerance within the plant.
*   **Foliar Protectants:**
    *   **Kaolin clay:** Apply **Kaolin clay** (e.g., Surround WP) at 2.5-5% (25-50 g/L of water) as a foliar spray. This forms a reflective white film on leaves and fruits, reducing surface temperature and sunburn. Reapply after heavy rains or every 10-14 days during high-temperature periods.

**3. Hardness in Fruit**

"Hardness in fruit" can refer to several issues, most commonly premature harvesting, inadequate ripening due to environmental factors, or severe water stress during fruit development.

*   **Optimal Harvesting Time:** Harvest plums at their physiological maturity. Harvesting too early will result in hard, sour fruits that may not ripen properly or develop full flavor. Learn to identify the specific maturity indices for your plum variety (e.g., skin color change, slight softening, taste, ease of detachment from the stem).
*   **Water Management:** Consistent and adequate irrigation throughout the fruit development period is crucial. Water stress can lead to smaller, harder fruits with poor juice content and inhibited ripening.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium:** Adequate potassium is vital for fruit development, size, and quality, including proper ripening and texture. Ensure soil tests indicate sufficient potassium. If deficient, apply **Sulphate of Potash** (SOP) as per soil test recommendations, typically 100-200 g per tree, split into two applications during fruit development.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** A balanced supply of all essential nutrients supports healthy fruit development and ripening processes.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Ensure trees are planted in locations with sufficient sunlight and good air circulation, which are important for proper fruit development and ripening. Avoid planting in areas prone to waterlogging or extreme wind exposure.
