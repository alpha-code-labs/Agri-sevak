As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in plum orchards in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are significant soil pests that can severely impact the health and productivity of plum trees.

### Control of Termites in Plum

Termites can cause considerable damage by feeding on the roots and collar region of plum trees, leading to weakening, poor growth, and even tree mortality, especially in young plants.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Pre-planting Treatment (for new orchards):**
    *   Before planting, treat the soil in the planting pit or trench.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix **2.5 ml** per litre of water and drench the soil in the planting pit thoroughly.
*   **Post-planting Treatment (for existing trees):**
    *   For established trees showing termite activity (mud channels on the trunk, hollowed wood), apply a soil drench around the base of the tree.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix **5 ml** per litre of water and apply **5-10 litres** of this solution per tree, depending on its size, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. Repeat if necessary, especially during dry periods.

### Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) in Plum

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect the roots of plum trees, causing characteristic galls or swellings. These galls impair the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit yield, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**Control Measures (Integrated Pest Management Approach):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Soil Solarization:** In fallow land before planting, cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during hot summer months (May-June) to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at **10-15 kg per tree** annually.
    *   **Neem Cake:** Apply **1-2 kg of Neem cake** per tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone, especially during planting or before active growth. Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial microbial activity.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   These are highly recommended as they are environmentally friendly and sustainable.
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply **2.5-5 kg per acre** mixed with FYM or compost, or as a soil drench at **5-10 g per litre** of water around the root zone of individual trees.
    *   **Trichoderma viride / Trichoderma harzianum:** Apply **2.5-5 kg per acre** mixed with FYM or compost, or as a soil drench at **5-10 g per litre** of water around the root zone. These fungi colonize the roots and suppress nematode populations.
    *   Apply biological agents when soil moisture is adequate and temperature is conducive for microbial activity.

3.  **Chemical Control (Use as a last resort and with caution):**
    *   Chemical nematicides are often highly toxic and their use is restricted. For plum, specific CIBRC-approved chemical nematicides with low environmental impact are limited.
    *   If nematode infestation is severe and biological/cultural methods are insufficient, it is strongly advised to **consult with HAU experts** for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines for plum. This ensures the use of an appropriate and approved chemical, applied safely and effectively.

**General Recommendations:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your plum trees for signs of termite activity or nematode damage (stunted growth, yellowing, root galls). Early detection allows for more effective control.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use healthy, nematode-free planting material from certified nurseries.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through balanced nutrition and proper irrigation, as healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks.

Please remember to always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective application of any pesticide.
