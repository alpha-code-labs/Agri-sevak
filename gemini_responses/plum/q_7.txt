Dear Farmer,

Based on scientific understanding and practices recommended for Haryana, here is the advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Plum:

**1. Dieback and Twig Blight in Plum:**

These conditions are often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria*, *Phomopsis*, *Cytospora*, *Monilinia*) or sometimes bacterial pathogens, and are exacerbated by stress factors. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect your plum trees and prune out all affected branches and twigs showing dieback or blight symptoms. Cut well into healthy wood, at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms.
    *   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy (burn or bury deep) all pruned material to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   **Orchard Hygiene:** Maintain good orchard hygiene by removing fallen leaves and fruit.
    *   **Stress Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, balanced nutrition, and manage other pests or diseases that might weaken the tree. Avoid mechanical injuries.

*   **Chemical Control (Apply after pruning and during susceptible periods):**
    *   For fungal dieback/twig blight:
        *   Spray with **Copper oxychloride** at 3 g/L of water. This can be applied as a protective spray, especially after pruning or during the dormant season.
        *   Alternatively, apply a systemic fungicide like **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L of water.
        *   Another option is a contact fungicide like **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water.
        *   For severe cases or as a rotation, **Thiophanate methyl** at 1 g/L of water can be used.

**2. Tikka Disease in Plum:**

*   This is not known to affect Plum. Tikka disease is primarily a disease of groundnut (peanut).
