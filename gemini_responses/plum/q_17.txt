As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Plum cultivation in Haryana to ensure optimal growth and fruit production:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 10-20 kg per tree annually.
    *   **Bearing trees (4 years and above):** 30-50 kg per tree annually.
    *   *Application:* Apply during late autumn or early winter (October-December) by spreading it evenly around the tree basin and incorporating it into the topsoil.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Young trees (1-3 years):** 5-10 kg per tree annually.
    *   **Bearing trees (4 years and above):** 15-25 kg per tree annually.
    *   *Application:* Similar to FYM, apply during late autumn or early winter, incorporating it into the soil around the tree. Vermicompost can also be applied in split doses, e.g., half before flowering and half after fruit set.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** 2-4 ml per litre of water. Apply at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1-2 litres per acre, diluted in sufficient water. Apply during active growth periods, typically split into 2-3 applications throughout the growing season.
    *   *Note:* **Sagarika** is a bio-stimulant that complements the nutrient supply from **FYM** and **Vermicompost** and should be used in addition to them, not as a replacement for bulk organic matter.
