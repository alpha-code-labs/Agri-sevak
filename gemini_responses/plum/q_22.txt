As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the cultivation practices of Plum in Haryana:

Plum (Prunus salicina and its hybrids) is a temperate fruit crop primarily propagated vegetatively for commercial fruit production. Direct sowing of seeds is not practiced for establishing an orchard, as it leads to genetic variability, delayed fruiting, and inconsistent fruit quality. Therefore, the following recommendations pertain to planting grafted or budded saplings.

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern (Planting Method):**
    *   Plum orchards are established by planting healthy, one-year-old grafted or budded saplings obtained from a reliable nursery.
    *   The most common planting pattern is the **Square System**, which facilitates inter-cultivation, irrigation, and other orchard operations. The **Hexagonal System** can also be adopted to accommodate more plants per unit area, especially on flat land.
    *   Pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter size should be dug well in advance (1-2 months) before planting. These pits should be refilled with a mixture of topsoil and 20-25 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM).
    *   Planting is best done during the dormant season, typically from December to February, when the plants are leafless.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   When planting grafted saplings, it is crucial to ensure that the graft union (the swollen part where the scion joins the rootstock) remains at least **15-20 cm above the soil surface**. This prevents the scion from rooting, which would negate the benefits of the rootstock.
    *   The root ball of the sapling should be placed at the same depth as it was in the nursery, ensuring that the roots are spread out properly in the pit.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   The optimal spacing for plum trees depends on the vigor of the scion variety, the type of rootstock used (standard, semi-dwarfing), soil fertility, and the chosen training system.
    *   For standard vigorous varieties and rootstocks commonly used in Haryana, a spacing of **5 meters x 5 meters** to **6 meters x 6 meters** is generally recommended.
    *   For high-density planting systems using semi-dwarfing rootstocks, closer spacing such as **4 meters x 3 meters** can be adopted, but this requires intensive management and specific rootstock selection.

*   **Seed Dose (Number of Plants per Acre):**
    *   As plums are propagated vegetatively, there is no "seed dose." Instead, the requirement is for the number of grafted saplings per unit area.
    *   Based on the recommended spacing:
        *   For **5 meters x 5 meters** spacing: Approximately **160 plants per acre**.
        *   For **6 meters x 6 meters** spacing: Approximately **110 plants per acre**.
        *   For high-density planting at **4 meters x 3 meters** spacing: Approximately **335 plants per acre**.
