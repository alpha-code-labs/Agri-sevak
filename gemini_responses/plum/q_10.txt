As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Plum cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to always follow the specific instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application.

### Control Measures for Pests in Plum:

**1. Borers (e.g., Stem Borers, Bark Borers, Shot-hole Borers)**

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stem, branches, or twigs, leading to weakening of the tree and sometimes death.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., sawdust-like frass, gum exudation, entry/exit holes).
    *   Prune and destroy affected branches well below the point of infestation.
    *   Maintain tree vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation to enhance natural resistance.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For stem and bark borers, swab the tree trunk and main branches with a solution of:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, for active boreholes, inject a small quantity of the above solution into the holes and plug them with mud.

**2. Caterpillars (e.g., Leaf-eating Caterpillars)**

Various caterpillar species can defoliate plum trees, especially during their larval stages.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Hand-pick and destroy caterpillars if the infestation is localized and manageable.
    *   Remove and destroy egg masses or webs.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray when caterpillars are young and actively feeding, using one of the following:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG at 0.2 g/L of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth**

This is not known to affect Plum. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf Folder**

Leaf folders are lepidopteran larvae that fold or roll leaves and feed from within, causing damage to foliage.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply a foliar spray targeting the larvae, using one of the following:
        *   **Indoxacarb** 14.5 SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5 SC at 0.3 ml/L of water.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and affected parts during spraying.
*   Consider the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any pesticide used, especially when fruit is present.
*   For specific local conditions and pest outbreaks, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
