As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding plum maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes suitable for Haryana conditions:

### Maturity Signs for Plum

Determining the correct maturity is crucial for optimal flavour, shelf life, and marketability. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Skin Colour:** The most reliable indicator. Plums change from green to their characteristic varietal colour (e.g., red, purple, yellow, or a deep reddish-purple for varieties like 'Kala Amritsari' or 'Satluj Purple'). Ensure the colour is uniform over most of the fruit surface.
*   **Flesh Firmness:** Gently press the fruit with your thumb. A mature plum should yield slightly to gentle pressure but should not be soft or mushy. It should feel firm but not hard.
*   **Taste and Aroma:** For home growers, tasting a fruit can confirm maturity. Ripe plums will be sweet with a balanced acidity and develop a characteristic aroma. Commercial growers may use a refractometer to measure Brix (sugar content), which typically ranges from 12-18% depending on the variety.
*   **Ease of Separation:** A mature plum will detach easily from the spur with a slight upward twist. If it requires significant force, it is likely not fully ripe.
*   **Presence of Bloom:** Many plum varieties develop a whitish, powdery coating called "bloom" on their skin. This natural wax layer indicates freshness and proper handling.

### Harvesting Time for Plum

Plum harvesting in Haryana typically occurs from **late May to July**, depending on the specific variety and local climatic conditions.

*   **Multiple Pickings:** Plums on a single tree do not ripen simultaneously. Therefore, harvesting is usually done in **2-3 pickings** over a period of 1-2 weeks.
*   **Early Varieties:** May end to early June.
*   **Mid-Season Varieties:** Mid-June to early July.
*   **Late Varieties:** Mid-July.
*   **Timing of Day:** Harvest during the cooler parts of the day, preferably in the early morning after the dew has dried, or in the late afternoon, to reduce field heat and maintain fruit quality.

### Cutting Process (Harvesting Method) for Plum

The harvesting method significantly impacts fruit quality and shelf life. Hand picking is the recommended method for fresh market plums.

*   **Hand Picking:** This is the most common and preferred method to prevent bruising and damage to the fruit.
    *   **Technique:** Gently grasp the fruit in your palm. With a slight upward twist, detach the fruit from the spur.
    *   **Stem Attachment:** Ideally, leave a **short stem (pedicel)** of about 0.5-1.0 cm attached to the fruit. This helps in reducing moisture loss, preventing pathogen entry, and improving the fruit's shelf life.
    *   **Using Tools:** For fruits that are difficult to detach without damaging the spur or the fruit, use **sharp, clean secateurs or clippers** to cut the stem, ensuring a clean cut and avoiding injury to the fruit or the fruiting wood.
*   **Careful Handling:**
    *   Place harvested fruits carefully into padded baskets or crates. Avoid dropping or tossing them, as plums are susceptible to bruising.
    *   Do not overfill containers to prevent crushing the lower layers of fruit.
    *   Move harvested fruit to a cool, shaded area as quickly as possible to remove field heat and maintain quality.
