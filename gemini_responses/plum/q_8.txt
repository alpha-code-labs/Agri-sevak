As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Plum orchards in Haryana.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plum trees, especially young shoots, leaves, and flowers, for the presence of pests and their natural enemies. Early detection is key to effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested plant parts during dormant pruning or early growing season.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth highly attractive to aphids and whiteflies.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve and encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps. These beneficial insects can significantly reduce pest populations. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm them.
4.  **Chemical Control:**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and biological control is insufficient, judicious application of CIBRC-approved insecticides is necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays during calm weather, preferably in the morning or late afternoon.

**CIBRC Approved Chemical Control Options for Sucking Pests in Plum:**

The following insecticides are CIBRC approved for use on fruit crops in India and are effective against the mentioned sucking pests. Always follow the label instructions for specific dosages and safety precautions.

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of **0.25 - 0.5 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Highly effective against aphids and whiteflies. Apply at a concentration of **0.3 - 0.5 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Effective against thrips, aphids, and some leafhoppers. Apply at a concentration of **1 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**.

*   **For a broader spectrum including Psylla, Aphids, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** A systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests. Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water**.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure that the last spray is applied well before fruit harvest to avoid chemical residues in the fruit.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, including the undersides of leaves, where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action (different chemical groups) to prevent pests from developing resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) suchs as gloves, mask, and protective clothing while handling and spraying insecticides. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.

By adopting this comprehensive IPM approach, plum growers in Haryana can effectively manage sucking pests, ensuring healthy trees and good fruit yields.
