To control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Plum, a combination of cultural practices and timely chemical interventions is recommended. Both pests are sap-suckers and can severely weaken the tree if not managed effectively.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for early signs of infestation, especially on branches, twigs, and the undersides of leaves.
    *   Prune and destroy heavily infested branches during dormancy or early infestation to reduce the pest load.
    *   Ensure good tree hygiene and remove weeds around the base of the tree, as they can harbor pests.

2.  **Chemical Control:**

    *   **Dormant Spray (Winter/Early Spring before bud break):**
        *   Apply **Horticultural Mineral Oil** (Paraffinic oil) at 20-30 ml per litre of water. This is highly effective in smothering overwintering scale insects and mealybug eggs/nymphs. Ensure thorough coverage of the trunk and branches.

    *   **During Active Growth (When pests are observed, especially crawlers/nymphs):**
        *   For Scale Insects and Mealybugs:
            *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g per litre of water.
            *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 1.25 ml per litre of water (effective against nymphs/crawlers by disrupting chitin synthesis).
            *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD at 0.75 ml per litre of water (systemic, effective against hidden pests).
            *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2 g per litre of water.

    *   **Application Notes:**
        *   Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, in leaf axils, and in bark crevices where pests tend to hide.
        *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
        *   Always read and strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions on the product label for specific dosages, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI) to ensure food safety and efficacy.
        *   Apply sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize phytotoxicity and maximize efficacy. Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.
