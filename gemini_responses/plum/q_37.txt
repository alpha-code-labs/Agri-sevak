Protecting plum trees from wild animals in Haryana requires an integrated approach, primarily focusing on physical barriers and cultural practices. The efficacy of chemical repellents against larger wild animals is often limited, and specific CIBRC-approved products for broad wild animal control on fruit trees are not commonly available or recommended for this purpose.

Here are the recommended methods:

*   **Physical Barriers:** These are generally the most effective and reliable methods.
    *   **Fencing:**
        *   **Barbed Wire Fencing:** A multi-strand fence (at least 5-7 strands) with strong, well-anchored posts can deter larger animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull) and Wild Boar. Ensure the fence is maintained regularly to prevent breaches.
        *   **Chain-Link Fencing:** More expensive but highly effective, especially if the bottom is buried partially (e.g., 30 cm deep) to prevent animals from digging underneath.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** A highly effective psychological barrier against most wild animals. It requires careful installation, regular maintenance, and strict adherence to safety regulations. Consult with local authorities regarding permits and safety standards.
    *   **Netting:** For protection against monkeys and birds, individual trees or smaller orchard sections can be covered with sturdy nylon or plastic netting, especially during the fruiting period. Ensure the mesh size is appropriate to prevent entry.
    *   **Tree Guards:** For young plum saplings, install wire mesh or plastic tree guards around the trunk. These protect against rodents, rabbits, and other small animals that might gnaw on the bark.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove fallen fruits, weeds, and debris from the orchard floor. This reduces attractants for various animals, including rodents and wild boars.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest plums promptly as soon as they ripen to minimize the period during which they are attractive to animals.
    *   **Pruning:** Maintain proper tree structure through regular pruning. This facilitates easier harvesting and reduces potential hiding spots for some animals.

*   **Auditory and Visual Scares:**
    *   **Scarecrows:** Can provide temporary deterrence, but animals often habituate quickly to static devices.
    *   **Reflective Tapes/CDs:** Hanging shiny objects can deter birds and sometimes monkeys for a short period, but their long-term effectiveness is limited.
    *   **Sound Devices:** Devices emitting loud noises or predator calls can be used, but their long-term effectiveness is limited due to habituation. Rotating different types of scares can prolong their efficacy.

*   **Guard Animals:**
    *   **Guard Dogs:** Well-trained guard dogs can be effective in deterring various wild animals, especially monkeys and smaller mammals, by their constant presence and barking. This requires proper care, feeding, and training of the animals.

*   **Chemical Repellents:**
    *   This is not known to affect Plum in terms of specific CIBRC-approved chemical repellents for broad wild animal control. Specific CIBRC-approved chemical repellents for broad wild animal control on fruit trees are not widely available or recommended for this purpose in Haryana. The efficacy of such repellents against larger, persistent wild animals like Nilgai, Wild Boar, or Monkeys is often limited and temporary. Therefore, physical barriers remain the most reliable method.
