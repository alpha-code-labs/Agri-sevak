As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Plum orchards in Haryana:

**1. Grasshopper:**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause defoliation, especially on young plum trees.
*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular weeding around the orchard reduces breeding sites.
    *   Hand-picking for small infestations can be effective.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control, spray when grasshopper populations are high.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted bug:**
This is not known to affect Plum. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

**3. Red cotton bug:**
This is not known to affect Plum. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black ants:**
Black ants are often secondary pests in plum orchards, primarily attracted to honeydew secreted by primary pests like aphids, mealybugs, or scale insects. They can also damage young shoots or fruits in search of sugary exudates.
*   **Integrated Pest Management:**
    *   First, identify and control the primary honeydew-producing pests if present, as this will naturally reduce ant activity.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing weeds and fallen debris.
    *   Apply sticky bands around the tree trunk to prevent ants from climbing into the canopy.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Fipronil** 0.01% GR (granules) can be used as bait or sprinkled around the base of the tree where ant activity is observed.
    *   For direct control on ant trails or nests, spray with:
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree, avoiding direct contact with foliage if possible.

Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any pesticide product before use to ensure safety and efficacy.
