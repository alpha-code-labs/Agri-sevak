As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in Plum orchards in Haryana:

First, let's address the specific parasitic weed mentioned:

*   **Orobanche (Broomrape):** This is not known to affect Plum. Orobanche species are typically parasitic on herbaceous dicotyledonous plants, such as those in the Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae families, and are not a significant pest of woody fruit trees like plum.

For the other weeds (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, and Phalaris minor), an integrated weed management approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective in plum orchards.

**General Principles for Weed Management in Plum Orchards:**

*   **Integrated Approach:** Combine various methods for sustainable and effective control.
*   **Prevention:** Prevent weed establishment by using clean planting material and managing surrounding areas.
*   **Timely Action:** Control weeds when they are young and most susceptible.
*   **Safety First:** Always prioritize the health of the plum trees. Herbicides must be applied carefully to avoid contact with tree foliage, green bark, and young shoots.

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**

1.  **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, wood chips, sugarcane trash) or use plastic mulches around the base of the trees. This suppresses weed growth, conserves soil moisture, and moderates soil temperature.
2.  **Inter-row Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between tree rows can control young weeds. Avoid deep cultivation near the tree base to prevent root damage.
3.  **Hand Weeding:** Essential for removing weeds close to the tree trunk, especially in young orchards, and for managing specific problematic weeds like Amarbail.
4.  **Mowing:** Regular mowing of the inter-row spaces can manage grass and broadleaf weeds, preventing them from setting seeds.
5.  **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy weed seeds and plant debris from the orchard and its surroundings.

**II. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**

**Important Precautions:**
*   Always read and follow the product label instructions carefully.
*   Apply herbicides as directed sprays, using protective shields to prevent drift onto plum foliage, green bark, or young shoots.
*   Ensure proper soil moisture for pre-emergence herbicides to be effective.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.

**1. For Broadleaf Weeds (Bathu, Congress grass, general broadleaf weeds):**

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (Applied to soil before weed emergence):**
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply at 400-800 ml/acre (equivalent to 94-188 g a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence spray to moist soil.
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.3 L/acre (equivalent to 300-390 g a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence spray.
    *   **Diuron** 80% WP: Apply at 0.8-1.6 kg/acre (equivalent to 640-1280 g a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence spray in established orchards.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Applied to actively growing weeds, directed spray only):**
    *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL: Apply at 1.0-2.0 L/acre (equivalent to 410-820 g a.i./acre) mixed with 200-300 L of water, as a directed spray. Add a non-ionic surfactant for enhanced efficacy.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL: Apply at 0.8-1.2 L/acre (equivalent to 192-288 g a.i./acre) mixed with 200-300 L of water, as a directed contact spray.
    *   **Glufosinate ammonium** 13.5% SL: Apply at 1.0-1.5 L/acre (equivalent to 135-202.5 g a.i./acre) mixed with 200-300 L of water, as a directed spray.

**2. For Narrowleaf Weeds (Phalaris minor, general grasses):**

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Apply at 1.0-1.3 L/acre (equivalent to 300-390 g a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence spray. (Effective against many annual grasses).
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC: Apply at 400-800 ml/acre (equivalent to 94-188 g a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence spray. (Also has activity on some grasses).

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (Directed spray or selective grass herbicides):**
    *   **Glyphosate** 41% SL: (As above, non-selective, directed spray).
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL: (As above, non-selective, directed spray).
    *   **Glufosinate ammonium** 13.5% SL: (As above, non-selective, directed spray).
    *   **Quizalofop ethyl** 5% EC: Apply at 400-500 ml/acre (equivalent to 20-25 g a.i./acre) as a post-emergence spray, specifically targeting grasses. This is a selective grass herbicide and generally safer for broadleaf crops/trees if drift is minimal.
    *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9% EC: Apply at 250-350 ml/acre (equivalent to 22.5-31.5 g a.i./acre) as a post-emergence spray for grass control.

**3. For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**

*   **Mechanical Removal:** This is the most effective and recommended method. Hand-pulling or carefully cutting affected plum branches (if the infestation is severe and localized) is crucial before the dodder sets seed. Remove and destroy the dodder plants away from the orchard.
*   **Pre-emergence Suppression:**
    *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC: Applying at 1.0-1.3 L/acre (equivalent to 300-390 g a.i./acre) as a pre-emergence spray to the soil can help suppress dodder seed germination.
*   **Post-emergence (Extreme caution required):**
    *   If dodder is present on weeds *around* the plum trees but not directly on the trees, **Glyphosate** 41% SL or **Paraquat dichloride** 24% SL can be used as a highly directed spot spray to kill the dodder and its host weed. *Avoid any contact with plum trees at all costs.* If dodder is on the plum tree itself, chemical control is extremely difficult without harming the tree, and mechanical removal remains the preferred option.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and the prevailing weed flora.
