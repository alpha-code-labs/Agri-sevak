As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling mites (Red spider mite and Rust mite) in Plum orchards in Haryana. Both Red spider mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and various species of Rust mites (Eriophyidae family, e.g., *Aculus fockeui*) are known to affect plum trees, causing significant damage if left unchecked.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Mite Control in Plum:**

1.  **Monitoring and Early Detection:**
    *   Regularly inspect plum trees, especially the undersides of leaves, for the presence of mites, webbing (for red spider mites), or bronzing/russeting (for rust mites). Early detection is crucial for effective control.

2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Orchard Hygiene:** Remove weeds and plant debris that can harbor mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation to reduce plant stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
    *   **Pruning:** Maintain proper tree canopy architecture through pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration, which can discourage mite build-up.

3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural predators of mites, such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp., *Phytoseiulus persimilis*), lady beetles, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.

4.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides/Miticides):**
    *   When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate miticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    Here are some CIBRC approved technical chemical names and their recommended dosages for mite control in plum:

    *   **For Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC:** 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. (Effective against both types of mites, translaminar action).
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. (Highly effective against rust mites and also helps control red spider mites and powdery mildew. **Caution:** Do not apply when temperatures are above 30-32°C as it can cause phytotoxicity).

    *   **Primarily for Red Spider Mite (with some activity on rust mites):**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 0.4 - 0.6 ml per litre of water. (Effective against all life stages of red spider mites).
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC:** 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. (Contact and stomach action against red spider mites).
        *   **Propargite 57% EC:** 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Contact action, good against motile stages of red spider mites).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Resistance Management:** Always rotate miticides from different chemical groups to prevent mites from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical repeatedly.
*   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites are often found on the undersides of leaves. Ensure complete spray coverage for effective control.
*   **Timing:** Apply miticides when mite populations are building up, typically during dry and warm periods.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always observe the specified Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) for each chemical to ensure fruit safety before harvest.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all label instructions carefully.
