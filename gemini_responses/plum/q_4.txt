Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that wilt, particularly *Verticillium* wilt, is a known issue affecting plum trees in various regions, including potentially Haryana. Parawilt, on the other hand, is often a physiological condition rather than a specific pathogen-induced disease.

Here's a comprehensive approach to manage wilt and parawilt in plum:

**Understanding the Conditions:**

*   **Wilt (Pathogen-induced):** Primarily caused by soil-borne fungi like *Verticillium dahliae* or *Fusarium oxysporum*. These pathogens enter through roots and block the vascular system, leading to wilting, yellowing, and dieback of branches, often on one side of the tree. Vascular discoloration (streaking) in the sapwood is a key diagnostic symptom.
*   **Parawilt (Physiological):** This term is often used for sudden wilting that is not directly caused by a specific pathogen. It's usually a stress-induced condition due to factors like sudden changes in temperature, water stress (either too much or too little), root damage, nutrient imbalances, or sudden heavy rainfall after a prolonged dry spell. The wilting may be temporary and reversible if the stress is alleviated.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.

**I. Cultural and Preventive Measures (Crucial for both Wilt and Parawilt):**

1.  **Site Selection:** Avoid planting plums in fields with a history of *Verticillium* wilt, especially if previous crops like cotton, potato, tomato, brinjal, or other susceptible vegetables were grown.
2.  **Resistant Rootstocks/Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose plum varieties or rootstocks known for better tolerance to wilt. Consult with HAU for specific recommendations.
3.  **Soil Solarization:** Before planting, especially in areas with a history of soil-borne diseases, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks during the hot summer months (May-June). This helps reduce pathogen inoculum.
4.  **Soil Health Management:**
    *   Improve soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which stresses roots and favors some pathogens.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg/tree annually) to enhance soil organic matter and microbial activity.
5.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods. Avoid both water stress and overwatering.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone and minimize water loss.
6.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced fertilization based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible to diseases.
    *   Micronutrient deficiencies can also stress trees, making them prone to wilting.
7.  **Weed Control:** Keep the area around plum trees free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for wilt pathogens.
8.  **Avoid Root Injury:** Be careful during inter-cultivation practices to prevent mechanical damage to the roots, which can create entry points for pathogens.
9.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy any severely wilted or dead branches/trees to prevent the spread of pathogens.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit after pruning each tree.

**II. Biological Control (For Pathogen-induced Wilt):**

1.  **Bio-fungicides:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride:** Apply 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, or as a soil drench at 5-10 g/L water around the root zone. This helps suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost, or as a soil drench at 5-10 g/L water around the root zone. It acts as a plant growth promoter and biocontrol agent.

**III. Chemical Control (For Pathogen-induced Wilt - Use with caution and as a last resort):**

Chemical control for established vascular wilts is often challenging and less effective than preventive measures. However, for early stages or as a prophylactic measure, the following can be considered:

1.  **Fungicides (Soil Drench):**
    *   **Carbendazim:** Drench the soil around the affected tree with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L water. The quantity of solution depends on the tree size (e.g., 5-10 L per mature tree). Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl:** Drench the soil around the affected tree with a solution of **Thiophanate Methyl** at 1-2 g/L water. The quantity of solution depends on the tree size. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always confirm the exact cause of wilting through laboratory diagnosis if possible, as symptoms can be similar for different issues.
*   Follow label instructions for all chemical and biological products regarding dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Consult with local HAU extension specialists for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the prevalent diseases in your area.
