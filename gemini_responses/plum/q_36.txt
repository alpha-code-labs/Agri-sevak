As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice to improve yield, fruit quality, and storage life for plum cultivation in Haryana.

Plum (Prunus salicina) is a valuable fruit crop, and optimizing its production requires an integrated approach covering orchard management, nutrition, and post-harvest handling.

### I. Improving Yield

To maximize plum yield, focus on robust plant health, optimal fruit set, and efficient resource utilization.

1.  **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding varieties well-suited to Haryana's agro-climatic conditions. Recommended varieties include Satluj Purple, Kala Amritsari, Titron, and Alubokhara.
2.  **Pollination Management:** Many plum varieties are self-incompatible or show improved fruit set with cross-pollination.
    *   Plant compatible pollinizer varieties within the orchard.
    *   Introduce beehives (3-5 hives per acre) during the flowering period to enhance pollination.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Based on soil and leaf analysis, apply balanced nutrients.
    *   **Macronutrients:**
        *   **Nitrogen (N):** Essential for vegetative growth. Apply in split doses.
        *   **Phosphorus (P):** Important for root development and flowering.
        *   **Potassium (K):** Crucial for fruit development, size, and overall plant vigor.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Boron (B):** Critical for pollen viability, fruit set, and development. Foliar spray of Borax (1.5 g/L) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1 g/L) at pre-bloom and petal fall stages.
        *   **Zinc (Zn):** Important for enzyme activity and growth. Foliar spray of Zinc sulphate (0.5%) or **Zinc EDTA** (0.1%) during spring flush.
4.  **Water Management:** Provide consistent irrigation, especially during critical stages like flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Avoid water stress, which can lead to fruit drop and reduced size. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.
5.  **Pruning and Training:**
    *   **Training:** Establish a strong framework (e.g., modified leader system) in young trees.
    *   **Annual Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, or crossing branches. Prune to maintain an open canopy for better light penetration and air circulation, which promotes fruit bud formation on healthy wood.
6.  **Weed Management:** Control weeds to reduce competition for water and nutrients.
    *   **Manual/Mechanical Weeding:** Regular weeding around the tree basin.
    *   **Chemical Control (Shielded application to avoid contact with tree bark/foliage):**
        *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): 4-6 ml/L of water (or 1-2 kg a.i./acre) as a post-emergence, non-selective herbicide.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): 2-3 ml/L of water (or 0.5-1 kg a.i./acre) as a post-emergence, contact herbicide.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality

High-quality plums are characterized by good size, uniform color, firmness, and desirable taste.

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Adequate potassium is vital for fruit size, sugar accumulation, color development, and overall fruit quality.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Foliar sprays of **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1% solution, i.e., 5-10 g/L) applied 2-3 times during fruit development can improve fruit firmness, reduce physiological disorders, and enhance storage potential.
    *   **Boron (B):** As mentioned for yield, boron also contributes to fruit development and quality.
2.  **Fruit Thinning:** Essential for achieving optimal fruit size and color.
    *   **Manual Thinning:** Thin fruits manually 3-4 weeks after fruit set, leaving 2-3 fruits per cluster and spacing them 10-15 cm apart on the branch. This reduces competition among fruits.
3.  **Water Management:** Consistent soil moisture is crucial. Irregular watering can lead to fruit cracking or poor development.
4.  **Pruning:** Maintain an open canopy to ensure good light penetration to all parts of the tree, which is essential for uniform fruit color development and sugar accumulation.
5.  **Growth Regulators:**
    *   **Gibberellic acid** (GA3): Can be used at 10-20 ppm (mg/L) at specific stages to improve fruit size, though its application needs careful timing and concentration.
    *   **Ethephon:** For uniform ripening and enhanced color development, a pre-harvest spray of **Ethephon** (100-200 ppm, i.e., 0.1-0.2 ml/L of 40% SL formulation) can be applied 7-10 days before anticipated harvest, depending on the variety and desired effect.

### III. Improving Storage Life

Extending the storage life of plums requires careful handling and appropriate post-harvest treatments.

1.  **Harvesting at Optimal Maturity:**
    *   Harvest plums when they reach physiological maturity but are still firm, typically when they show characteristic color development but are not fully soft. Over-ripe fruits have a very short shelf life.
    *   Harvest early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize field heat.
    *   Handle fruits gently to avoid bruises, cuts, or abrasions, which are entry points for pathogens.
2.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Rapidly remove field heat immediately after harvest by forced-air cooling or hydro-cooling to bring fruit temperature down to 0-1°C within a few hours. This significantly slows down respiration and ripening.
3.  **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Fungicide Dip:** To control post-harvest rots, dip fruits in a solution of CIBRC-approved fungicides.
        *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** (70% WP): 0.5-1 g/L of water.
        *   Ensure proper drying after dipping before packaging.
    *   **Calcium Treatment:** Dipping fruits in a 0.5-1% solution of **Calcium chloride** for 5-10 minutes can further enhance firmness and reduce physiological disorders during storage.
4.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Temperature:** Store plums at low temperatures, ideally 0-1°C.
    *   **Relative Humidity:** Maintain high relative humidity (90-95%) to prevent moisture loss and shriveling.
5.  **Packaging:**
    *   Use well-ventilated crates or cartons.
    *   Individual fruit wraps or tray packs can reduce physical damage and spread of decay.

By implementing these practices, plum growers in Haryana can significantly enhance their yields, improve fruit quality, and extend the market availability of their produce. Always refer to specific product labels for precise application rates and safety precautions.
