As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for plum cultivation in Haryana:

**Seed Treatment for Plum:**

Plums (Prunus domestica, Prunus salicina, etc.) are primarily propagated vegetatively through grafting, budding, or cuttings to ensure true-to-type plants and early fruiting. Commercial plum cultivation does not typically involve propagation from seeds. Therefore, a chemical seed treatment process, as commonly applied to annual crops, is **not known to affect Plum** in commercial orchard establishment. If seeds were to be used for rootstock production, the primary treatment would involve stratification (cold treatment) to break dormancy, rather than chemical seed treatment.

**Soil Treatment for Plum:**

Effective soil treatment is crucial for establishing a healthy plum orchard. This involves thorough pre-plant preparation and, if necessary, targeted treatments for specific soil-borne pests and diseases based on soil analysis and historical issues.

**1. Pre-Plant Soil Preparation:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine nutrient status, pH, and the presence of soil-borne pathogens or nematodes. This is fundamental for informed decision-making.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost at 20-30 tonnes per acre during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and beneficial microbial activity.
*   **pH Correction:** Plums generally prefer slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 5.5-7.0). If soil pH is outside this range, amend as per soil test recommendations (e.g., agricultural lime for acidic soils, gypsum for sodic soils).
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the land deeply (at least 45-60 cm) and harrow thoroughly to break up hardpans, improve soil aeration, and ensure good drainage, which is critical for plum root health.

**2. Targeted Soil Treatments (Based on Soil Test and History of Infestation):**

*   **For Nematode Management (if high population detected in soil test):**
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3% G** at 10-15 kg/acre by broadcasting and thoroughly mixing into the soil before planting, or apply in the planting pit. *Note: Use of Carbofuran should be strictly as per local agricultural department guidelines and CIBRC recommendations, considering its restricted use status.*

*   **For Termite Control (if prevalent in the area):**
    *   Apply **Fipronil 0.3% G** at 15-20 kg/acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil before planting, or apply in the planting pit.
    *   Alternatively, drench the planting pits with **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml/L of water, ensuring thorough mixing with the soil before planting.

*   **For Root Rot Prevention (especially in poorly drained soils or areas with a history of disease):**
    *   Drench the planting pits with a solution of **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water, ensuring the soil around the root zone is thoroughly wetted.
    *   Alternatively, drench with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water.

Always consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the latest CIBRC guidelines for safe and effective pesticide use. Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approaches, including the use of resistant rootstocks and biological control agents, are also highly encouraged for sustainable plum cultivation.
