As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the recommended cultivation practices for Tobacco in Haryana. Tobacco cultivation typically involves raising seedlings in a nursery and then transplanting them to the main field.

Here are the recommended practices:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Nursery Raising:** Tobacco seeds are very small and delicate, thus they are first sown in well-prepared raised nursery beds. These beds are typically 1 meter wide and of a convenient length (e.g., 5-10 meters). The seeds are either broadcast evenly over the bed surface or sown in shallow lines. They are then lightly covered with a thin layer (0.5 cm) of fine sand, sieved soil, or well-decomposed farmyard manure. The beds are often covered with straw or shade nets initially to protect the germinating seedlings from direct sun and heavy rain.
    *   **Transplanting:** Once the seedlings reach a suitable size (typically 10-15 cm in height with 5-6 true leaves, usually 45-60 days after sowing), they are carefully pulled from the nursery and transplanted manually into the main field. Transplanting is typically done in rows.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   **Nursery:** Seeds are sown very shallowly, just covered with approximately 0.5 cm of fine soil or sand. Deeper sowing can significantly reduce germination rates.
    *   **Main Field (Transplanting):** Seedlings are planted to the depth of their root ball, ensuring the collar region (where the stem meets the roots) is at or slightly below the soil surface. This encourages good root establishment and prevents the stem from being buried too deeply, which can lead to stem rot.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Spacing in the main field varies based on the tobacco type (e.g., chewing tobacco, hookah tobacco) and the desired leaf size and quality. A common spacing for tobacco types grown in Haryana is:
        *   **Row-to-row:** 90 cm to 100 cm
        *   **Plant-to-plant:** 50 cm to 60 cm
    *   This spacing typically results in a plant population of approximately 16,000 to 22,000 plants per hectare.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   Tobacco seeds are extremely small. The seed dose is calculated based on the nursery area required to produce enough healthy seedlings for one hectare of the main field.
    *   To plant one hectare of the main field, approximately 100-125 square meters of nursery area is typically required.
    *   The recommended seed dose for this nursery area is **30-50 grams** of good quality seed per 100 square meters of nursery bed. This translates to approximately **3-5 grams** per 10 square meters of nursery.
