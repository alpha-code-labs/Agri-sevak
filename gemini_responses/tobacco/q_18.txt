As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations regarding the use of growth regulators and essential nutrients in tobacco cultivation for Haryana:

**1. Ethrel (Ethephon)**
**Ethephon** is a plant growth regulator commonly used in tobacco for promoting uniform ripening and for sucker control.

*   **For Ripening:**
    *   **Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of 1.0 - 2.0 ml per litre of water (equivalent to 390 - 780 ppm) as a foliar spray.
    *   **Application:** Spray uniformly on mature leaves when they start showing signs of yellowing, typically 3-5 days before harvesting. Ensure thorough coverage.
    *   **Note:** The exact timing and concentration may vary based on tobacco type, environmental conditions, and desired ripening speed.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
The use of **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** as a growth regulator in tobacco is generally not recommended.

*   **Reason:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. Even at very low concentrations, its application can cause severe phytotoxicity, abnormal growth, and significant damage to tobacco plants, negatively impacting yield and quality. Therefore, there is no recommended dose for its use as a growth regulator in tobacco.

**3. Boron**
Boron is an essential micronutrient, not a hormone, but it plays a critical role in various physiological processes vital for tobacco growth and development, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, and flowering. Its deficiency can severely impact plant health and yield.

*   **For Boron Deficiency Correction/Supplementation (Foliar Application):**
    *   **Dose:** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at a concentration of 1.0 - 2.0 g per litre of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
    *   **Application:** Spray uniformly on the foliage at critical growth stages, such as during active vegetative growth and before flowering. Repeat if deficiency symptoms persist or based on soil/tissue analysis.
    *   **Note:** For soil application, the dose would be higher, typically 1-2 kg of actual Boron per acre, applied pre-planting or at planting, depending on soil test recommendations. Foliar application is often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies.
