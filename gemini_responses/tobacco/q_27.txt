As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with the scientifically verified requirements for tobacco cultivation in Haryana.

Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) has specific requirements for optimal growth and yield:

### Climate

Tobacco is a warm-season crop and thrives under specific climatic conditions:

*   **Temperature:**
    *   **Germination:** Requires temperatures around 24-27°C.
    *   **Growth:** Optimal growth occurs between 20-30°C. Temperatures below 10°C or above 35°C can hinder growth.
    *   **Frost:** Tobacco is highly susceptible to frost, which can severely damage or kill the plants.
*   **Rainfall:**
    *   Requires a total rainfall of 500-1200 mm during its growing season, depending on the variety and soil type.
    *   Well-distributed rainfall is crucial. Excessive rainfall, especially during the ripening and harvesting stages, can reduce leaf quality and promote diseases.
    *   Drought conditions can lead to stunted growth and poor leaf development.
*   **Sunshine:** Requires abundant sunshine (at least 6-8 hours daily) for good photosynthesis and leaf development.
*   **Humidity:** Moderate humidity is generally preferred. High humidity combined with high temperatures can increase the incidence of fungal diseases.

### Soil Type

The ideal soil type for tobacco varies somewhat with the type of tobacco being grown, but general characteristics are important:

*   **Texture:**
    *   **Flue-cured Tobacco:** Prefers light-textured, well-drained sandy loams to loamy sands. These soils promote good root development and produce leaves with desirable aroma and burning quality.
    *   **Chewing/Bidi Tobacco:** Can tolerate slightly heavier soils, such as sandy clay loams or loams, which help in producing thicker, heavier leaves.
*   **pH:** Optimal soil pH ranges from 5.5 to 6.5 (slightly acidic to neutral). Highly acidic or alkaline soils can lead to nutrient deficiencies or toxicities.
*   **Organic Matter:** Soils with moderate organic matter content are beneficial, as they improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability. However, excessively rich soils can lead to rank growth and poor leaf quality for certain types.
*   **Nutrient Status:** Requires soils with good fertility, but balanced nutrient management is critical. Excess nitrogen can delay maturity and reduce leaf quality, while potassium is vital for burning quality.

### Drainage Requirement

Drainage is one of the most critical factors for successful tobacco cultivation:

*   **Well-Drained Soils:** Tobacco requires deep, well-drained soils. Its root system is sensitive to waterlogging.
*   **Impact of Waterlogging:** Even temporary waterlogging can cause severe damage, leading to root rot, nutrient leaching, and oxygen deprivation, which can result in wilting, yellowing, and eventual death of the plant.
*   **Subsoil:** The subsoil should also be permeable to allow for deep root penetration and prevent water accumulation. Hardpans or impervious layers close to the surface are detrimental.
*   **Aeration:** Good soil aeration is essential for healthy root respiration and nutrient uptake.

In summary, for successful tobacco cultivation in Haryana, selecting a site with a warm, frost-free climate, well-drained sandy loam to loam soils with a slightly acidic to neutral pH, and ensuring excellent drainage is paramount.
