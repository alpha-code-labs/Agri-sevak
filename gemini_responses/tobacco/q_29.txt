As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding 'Dropping' in Tobacco for Haryana, India:

*   **Flower drop in Tobacco:** In commercial tobacco cultivation for leaf production, flowering is generally undesirable as it diverts energy from leaf development. Growers typically practice 'topping' (removal of the flower head) to promote larger, higher-quality leaves. Therefore, flower drop is not usually considered a problem that requires specific control measures to prevent it. If premature or excessive flower drop occurs before topping, it may indicate underlying plant stress (e.g., nutrient deficiency, water stress, extreme temperatures, or pest/disease pressure), which should be investigated and addressed. However, the primary management strategy for flowering in tobacco is topping, not preventing flower drop.

*   **Fruit drop in Tobacco:** Tobacco plants produce capsules (fruits) containing seeds. These fruits are not harvested in commercial leaf tobacco production. Therefore, 'fruit drop' is not a known concern or condition that requires control measures in tobacco cultivation.

*   **Tinda/Boll dropping in Tobacco:** This is not known to affect Tobacco. 'Tinda' refers to a type of gourd, and 'Boll' refers to the fruit of cotton. Neither of these terms nor conditions applies to tobacco.
