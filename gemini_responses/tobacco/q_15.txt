As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Tobacco in Haryana:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to tobacco plants, especially at the seedling and young plant stages, by feeding on leaves.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field sanitation by removing weeds and crop residues that can serve as breeding grounds.
    *   Deep plowing after harvest can expose and kill eggs laid in the soil.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers can be effective for small infestations, especially in nurseries.
*   **Chemical Control (Apply when infestation is observed):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.
    *   **Cypermethrin** 25% EC: 200-240 ml per acre mixed in 200-400 L of water.

### 2. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris)

This is not known to affect Tobacco. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage, cauliflower).

### 3. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)

This is not known to affect Tobacco. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other plants in the Malvaceae family, feeding on developing seeds.

### 4. Black ants

Black ants are generally not direct pests of tobacco plants by feeding on them. However, they can be a nuisance, disturb seedlings, or protect other sap-sucking pests like aphids (by feeding on their honeydew), which can indirectly harm the crop.

**Control Measures (if ants are causing damage or protecting other pests):**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain good field hygiene to reduce nesting sites.
    *   Control sap-sucking pests like aphids, as ants are often attracted to their honeydew.
*   **Chemical Control (Targeted application if necessary):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.0 - 2.5 L per acre as a drench around the base of affected plants or as a perimeter spray to deter ants from entering the field/nursery.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 6.6 - 10 kg per acre, applied to the soil if ants are nesting and causing significant disturbance to seedlings.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 200-250 ml per acre as a spot treatment or perimeter spray to deter ants.

**General Recommendations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, are always recommended for sustainable pest control.
