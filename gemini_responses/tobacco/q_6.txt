As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must emphasize that there are no direct chemical treatments (viricides) available to cure viral diseases in plants, including tobacco. The control strategies primarily focus on prevention, managing insect vectors that transmit these viruses, and adopting sound cultural practices.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

1.  **Leaf curl (Tobacco Leaf Curl Virus - ToLCV):** This is a significant viral disease affecting tobacco in Haryana, transmitted by whiteflies.
2.  **Mosaic (Tobacco Mosaic Virus - TMV):** This is one of the most common and destructive viral diseases of tobacco worldwide, highly contagious and mechanically transmitted.
3.  **Yellow vein clearing (Tobacco Yellow Vein Clearing Virus - TYVCV):** This virus is known to affect tobacco and is typically transmitted by whiteflies.
4.  **Stripe virus:** "Stripe virus" is not a commonly recognized distinct viral disease name for tobacco. However, various viruses can cause stripe-like symptoms (e.g., Tobacco Streak Virus can cause streaking). If such symptoms are observed, the general viral management strategies outlined below should be followed.
5.  **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Tobacco. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is a major pathogen of citrus.
6.  **Stunt virus (Tobacco Stunt Virus - TSV):** This virus is known to affect tobacco, causing stunting and root necrosis. It is soil-borne and can be transmitted by fungi.

**General Control Measures for Viral Diseases in Tobacco:**

Since direct chemical control for viruses is not possible, an integrated approach focusing on prevention and vector management is crucial.

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices:**

*   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant tobacco varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to common viral diseases like TMV and ToLCV. Consult HAU for recommended varieties suitable for Haryana.
*   **Sanitation:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately upon identification to prevent further spread.
    *   Destroy crop residues thoroughly after harvest.
    *   Control weeds in and around tobacco fields, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their vectors.
*   **Nursery Management:** Raise healthy, virus-free seedlings in protected nurseries (e.g., under insect-proof nets) to prevent early infection.
*   **Avoid Mechanical Transmission (especially for TMV):**
    *   Workers should wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling tobacco plants, especially after using tobacco products (cigarettes, bidis, chewing tobacco) which can carry TMV.
    *   Disinfect tools and equipment regularly.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle, especially for soil-borne viruses like Tobacco Stunt Virus.
*   **Mulching:** Use reflective mulches (e.g., silver-colored plastic mulch) in the early stages of crop growth to deter insect vectors like whiteflies and aphids.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth, which can help plants tolerate stress.

**II. Vector Management (for Leaf Curl, Yellow Vein Clearing, and other insect-transmitted viruses):**

Controlling the insect vectors (primarily whiteflies and aphids) is critical to prevent the spread of many tobacco viruses.

**A. Nursery Stage:**

*   **Seedling Treatment:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply as a soil drench at 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml/acre equivalent) at the time of transplanting or 7-10 days after transplanting.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply as a soil drench at 0.2 g per litre of water (or 40-50 g/acre equivalent) at the time of transplanting.

**B. Field Stage (Foliar Sprays):**

For managing whiteflies and aphids in the field, rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Apply sprays when vector populations reach economic threshold levels.

*   **For Whiteflies:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-50 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 50-100 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 500-600 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC:** 160-200 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **For Aphids:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 125-150 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 40-50 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 50-100 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** 120 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** 660 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide and adhere to the recommended dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the local agricultural extension office or HAU experts.
