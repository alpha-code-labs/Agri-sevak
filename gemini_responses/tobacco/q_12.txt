Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sucking pests that can cause considerable damage to tobacco crops by feeding on plant sap, leading to yellowing, wilting, stunted growth, and reduced yield. They also excrete honeydew, which promotes the growth of sooty mold, interfering with photosynthesis.

For effective management, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is recommended, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Tobacco:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and stem joints, for early detection of pests.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the field free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.
    *   **Water Jet:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge pests from the plants.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri* for mealybugs) and parasitic wasps, which can help in suppressing pest populations. However, their effectiveness might be limited in severe outbreaks.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When pest populations are high and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, chemical intervention becomes necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where these pests often reside.

    The following CIBRC approved technical chemicals are recommended for the control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Tobacco:

    *   **For Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **125-150 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **50-100 g per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at a rate of **500-600 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **500-600 ml per acre** in 200-300 litres of water. This is particularly effective against nymphs of mealybugs and scales by inhibiting chitin synthesis.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
    *   Ensure proper coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and stem junctions where these pests tend to aggregate.
    *   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
    *   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the label before harvesting.
