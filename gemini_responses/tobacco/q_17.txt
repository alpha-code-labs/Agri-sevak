As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Tobacco cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific verification:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply 10-15 tonnes per acre.
    *   Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed and incorporate it thoroughly into the soil at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow-release source of essential nutrients.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   Vermicompost can be used as a more nutrient-dense alternative or supplement to FYM. Incorporate it into the soil before planting for enhanced nutrient availability and microbial activity.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based bio-stimulant):**
    *   **For soil application (granular form):** Apply **8-10 kg per acre** at the time of transplanting or during early growth stages.
    *   **For foliar spray (liquid form):** Apply **250-500 ml per acre**, diluted in an appropriate volume of water (e.g., 150-200 litres of water), at critical growth stages. Typically, two sprays are recommended: the first 20-30 days after transplanting, and the second 40-50 days after transplanting. This helps in overall plant vigour, root development, and stress tolerance.
