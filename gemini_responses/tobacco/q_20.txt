As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise that addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is crucial for optimal growth, yield, and quality. Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, plant tissue analysis to confirm specific deficiencies and their severity. This will help in precise and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies in Tobacco:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always start with a soil test to determine the actual nutrient status of your field.
*   **Foliar Application:** Often preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially when symptoms are visible, as nutrients are absorbed directly by the leaves.
*   **Timing:** Apply micronutrients at critical growth stages or when deficiency symptoms first appear.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies in Tobacco:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
*   **Affects Tobacco:** Yes, Zinc deficiency is common in tobacco and can significantly impact growth.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a purplish discoloration on the underside of leaves.
*   **Recommended Chemicals and Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 10-25 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Zinc Sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at a concentration of 0.5% (5 g/L of water). Repeat if necessary after 10-15 days.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency
*   **Affects Tobacco:** Yes, Iron deficiency can occur, particularly in alkaline soils common in Haryana.
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis of the youngest leaves, with veins remaining green. In severe cases, the entire young leaf may turn pale yellow or white.
*   **Recommended Chemicals and Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (most effective for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Ferrous Sulphate heptahydrate** (19% Fe) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use **Fe-EDTA** (12% Fe) at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Add a suitable wetting agent to improve absorption. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
*   **Affects Tobacco:** Yes, Boron is crucial for tobacco, affecting cell wall formation, sugar transport, and flowering.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, thickening and brittleness of young leaves, distortion or death of terminal buds and growing points, short internodes, and sometimes a dark green, leathery appearance of leaves.
*   **Recommended Chemicals and Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting - *use with caution due to narrow safety margin*):**
        *   Apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (10.5-11.3% B) at 4-8 kg/acre.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at a concentration of 0.1-0.2% (1-2 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at a concentration of 0.05-0.1% (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   *Caution:* Over-application of Boron can lead to toxicity, so precise measurement is essential.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
*   **Affects Tobacco:** Yes, Calcium is vital for cell wall integrity and overall plant structure in tobacco.
*   **Symptoms:** Affects young leaves and growing points. Terminal buds may die, young leaves become distorted, curled, and show necrosis (death of tissue) at the tips and margins. Root growth is also impaired.
*   **Recommended Chemicals and Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Calcium Nitrate** (15.5% N, 19% Ca) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Calcium Chloride** (27-30% Ca) at a concentration of 0.2-0.4% (2-4 g/L of water).
        *   Repeat applications every 7-10 days until symptoms subside.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
*   **Affects Tobacco:** Yes, Magnesium deficiency is common in tobacco, especially in sandy soils or where potassium levels are high.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of older leaves, starting from the margins and progressing inwards, often leaving a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern with green veins. Leaves may become brittle and curl upwards.
*   **Recommended Chemicals and Application:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-planting or at planting):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) at 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Magnesium Sulphate heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) at a concentration of 1-2% (10-20 g/L of water). Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
*   **Affects Tobacco:** Yes, Manganese deficiency can occur in tobacco, particularly in organic or high pH soils.
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of young leaves, similar to iron deficiency, but often accompanied by small necrotic (dead) spots appearing within the chlorotic areas. Veins remain green.
*   **Recommended Chemicals and Application:**
    *   **Foliar Spray (most effective):**
        *   Spray **Manganese Sulphate** (e.g., Monohydrate 30.5% Mn or Tetrahydrate 23% Mn) at a concentration of 0.5-1.0% (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Add a suitable wetting agent. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays and avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day to prevent leaf scorching. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, please consult with the experts at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension office.
