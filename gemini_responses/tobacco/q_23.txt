As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Tobacco cultivation, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions and common pest/disease challenges in the region.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Tobacco

The primary objective of seed treatment in tobacco is to protect young seedlings from early-season soil-borne diseases, particularly the damping-off complex, which can cause significant losses in nurseries.

*   **For control of Damping-off complex** (caused by *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*, and *Rhizoctonia* species):
    *   Treat tobacco seeds with **Thiram** @ 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Carbendazim** @ 1.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   For a broader spectrum of protection against various fungal pathogens, a combination product containing **Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP** can be used @ 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Tobacco

Soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and early weed competition in both nursery beds and the main field.

#### A. Nursery Soil Treatment

*   **For Damping-off and other soil-borne fungal diseases:**
    *   Before sowing, incorporate **Carbendazim 50% WP** @ 10-15 grams per square meter of nursery bed, ensuring it is thoroughly mixed with the top 10-15 cm of soil.
    *   As a prophylactic measure or at the first sign of damping-off, drench the nursery beds with **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL** @ 2-3 ml per liter of water.
*   **For Root-knot Nematodes** (*Meloidogyne* species, if a known problem in the nursery):
    *   Incorporate **Carbofuran 3G** @ 10-15 kg per acre (adjust the quantity proportionally for the nursery bed area) into the soil 7-10 days before sowing.

#### B. Main Field Soil Treatment (Pre-transplanting)

*   **For Root-knot Nematodes** (*Meloidogyne* species):
    *   Apply **Carbofuran 3G** @ 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before transplanting.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Phorate 10G** @ 10 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before transplanting.
*   **For Black Shank** (*Phytophthora nicotianae*) **and other soil-borne fungal diseases:**
    *   Apply **Metalaxyl 35% WS** @ 1-2 kg per acre, mixed with dry sand or soil, and broadcast evenly before transplanting, followed by light irrigation.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** @ 2-2.5 kg per acre as a soil drench around the root zone of transplanted seedlings.
*   **For Southern Blight** (*Sclerotium rolfsii*):
    *   Apply **Validamycin 3% L** @ 1-2 liters per acre as a soil drench around the base of plants, especially in problematic areas.
*   **For Pre-emergence Weed Control:**
    *   **Pre-plant incorporation:** Apply **Fluchloralin 45% EC** @ 1-1.5 liters per acre and incorporate into the soil to a depth of 5-7 cm before transplanting.
    *   **Pre-emergence spray:** Apply **Pendimethalin 30% EC** @ 1-1.5 liters per acre as a uniform spray on the soil surface within 3 days of transplanting, ensuring adequate soil moisture.
