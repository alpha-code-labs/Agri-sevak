As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for effective and sustainable control of weeds in tobacco. This combines cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

All the weeds you have listed (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, Orobanche, and Phalaris minor) are known to affect tobacco cultivation in various regions, including Haryana.

### **Integrated Weed Management in Tobacco**

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Control (Essential for all weeds):**

1.  **Thorough Land Preparation:** Deep ploughing and repeated harrowing before transplanting helps to expose weed seeds to the sun, reducing their viability, and burying some deeper.
2.  **Timely Transplanting:** Ensuring healthy and vigorous tobacco seedlings are transplanted at the optimal time allows the crop to establish quickly and compete better with emerging weeds.
3.  **Intercultivation/Hoeing:** Perform 2-3 intercultivations or manual hoeing operations. The first one typically 20-25 days after transplanting, and subsequent ones as needed. This is highly effective for removing young weeds and aerating the soil.
4.  **Hand Weeding:** This is crucial, especially for parasitic weeds like Amarbail and Orobanche.
    *   **Amarbail:** Remove any infested tobacco plants or parts immediately and destroy them to prevent further spread.
    *   **Orobanche:** Hand-pull Orobanche shoots before they flower and set seeds. This is labor-intensive but critical to reduce the seed bank in the soil. Ensure the pulled shoots are removed from the field and destroyed.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate tobacco with non-host crops (e.g., cereals like wheat, maize, or legumes not susceptible to Orobanche) to break the life cycle of specific weeds, especially parasitic ones.
6.  **Use Clean Seed:** Ensure that tobacco seeds and any farm machinery are free from weed seeds, particularly those of Amarbail and Orobanche.

**B. Chemical Control (Use CIBRC approved technical chemical names only):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and in conjunction with cultural and mechanical methods. Always ensure proper calibration of sprayers and uniform application.

**1. For Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (including Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor):**

*   **Pre-plant Incorporation (PPI):**
    *   Apply **Fluchloralin 45% EC** at 0.9 - 1.35 L/acre (equivalent to 1.0-1.5 kg a.i./ha). Incorporate into the soil to a depth of 5-7 cm within 24 hours of application, before transplanting tobacco. This provides good control of many annual grasses and broadleaf weeds.
*   **Pre-emergence (PRE):**
    *   Apply **Pendimethalin 30% EC** at 1.0 - 1.35 L/acre (equivalent to 0.75-1.0 kg a.i./ha) within 2-3 days after transplanting tobacco, before weed emergence. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy. This also provides some suppression of Amarbail.

**2. For Specific Weed Problems:**

*   **For Grass Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor, if emerging post-transplanting):**
    *   Apply **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC** at 400 - 800 ml/acre (equivalent to 50-100 g a.i./ha) as a post-emergence spray when grass weeds are in the 2-4 leaf stage. This is a selective herbicide for grass control and is safe for tobacco.
*   **For Orobanche (Broomrape):**
    *   **Imazethapyr 10% SL** can be used, but its application requires extreme precision due to the narrow margin of safety for tobacco.
        *   Apply **Imazethapyr 10% SL** at a total dose of approximately 300 ml/acre (equivalent to 75 g a.i./ha) in 2-3 split applications. For example, apply 100-150 ml/acre per application.
        *   The first application can be made around 20-25 days after transplanting, followed by subsequent applications at 15-20 day intervals, depending on Orobanche emergence.
        *   **Crucial Note:** This herbicide can cause temporary phytotoxicity (yellowing or stunting) to tobacco if not applied precisely or if conditions are unfavorable. Always consult with local HAU experts for the exact timing and dosage based on your specific tobacco variety and field conditions.
*   **For Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   As mentioned under PRE herbicides, **Pendimethalin 30% EC** applied pre-emergence can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
    *   However, the primary control for Amarbail remains manual removal of infested plants or plant parts before it spreads.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the herbicide product.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
*   Ensure proper nozzle selection and spray volume for uniform coverage.
*   Avoid spray drift to non-target crops.
*   Monitor your fields regularly for weed emergence and adjust your management strategy accordingly.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and tobacco variety, it is always advisable to consult with the local agricultural extension officers or scientists at HAU, Hisar.
