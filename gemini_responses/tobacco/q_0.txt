As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Tobacco in Haryana.

**General Integrated Disease Management Principles for Tobacco:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting tobacco or other solanaceous crops (like tomato, potato, brinjal) in the same field for at least 2-3 years to break disease cycles.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, choose disease-resistant or tolerant tobacco varieties.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, volunteer plants, and weeds that can harbor pathogens.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth. Ensure balanced NPK application.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Use drip irrigation if possible. If using overhead irrigation, do so in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly. Avoid late evening irrigation.
*   **Seed Treatment:** Use treated seeds to prevent seedling diseases.

Here's how to control the specific fungal diseases you've mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria (Brown Spot/Leaf Spot) - *Alternaria alternata*

This disease is known to affect Tobacco, causing circular brown spots with concentric rings, primarily on older leaves.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 200 ml/acre

### 2. Anthracnose - *Colletotrichum tabacum*

This disease is known to affect Tobacco, causing small, water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and petioles, which turn brown to black and often become sunken.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre
*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 200-300 g/acre
*   **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 200 ml/acre

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Tobacco. "Blast" typically refers to a specific disease caused by *Pyricularia oryzae* in rice and other grasses.

### 4. Blight (General Fungal Blights)

"Blight" is a general term. In tobacco, fungal blights can be caused by various pathogens, including *Alternaria* (as mentioned above for Brown Spot/Early Blight) or *Rhizoctonia solani* (causing target spot/damping-off). For general fungal blight symptoms, broad-spectrum fungicides are recommended.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre

### 5. Brown Spot - *Alternaria alternata*

This is the same disease as Alternaria (see point 1). It is known to affect Tobacco.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.0-2.5 kg/acre
*   **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre
*   **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 200 ml/acre

### 6. Downy Mildew (Blue Mold) - *Peronospora tabacina*

This disease is known to affect Tobacco, causing yellow spots on the upper leaf surface and a characteristic purplish-grey fuzzy growth on the underside of leaves.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP:** 800-1000 g/acre
*   **Dimethomorph 9% + Mancozeb 60% WP:** 800-1000 g/acre
*   **Propamocarb hydrochloride 72.2% SL:** 800-1000 ml/acre

### 7. Powdery Mildew - *Golovinomyces cichoracearum* (formerly *Erysiphe cichoracearum*)

This disease is known to affect Tobacco, appearing as white, powdery patches on the upper surface of leaves, which can spread to the underside.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Sulphur 80% WP:** 1.5-2.0 kg/acre
*   **Myclobutanil 10% WP:** 160-200 g/acre
*   **Penconazole 10% EC:** 200 ml/acre
*   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 200 ml/acre

### 8. Grey Mildew (Grey Mould) - *Botrytis cinerea*

This disease is known to affect Tobacco, particularly under high humidity, causing water-soaked lesions, seedling blight, stem rot, and a characteristic grey fuzzy growth on affected tissues.

**Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**

*   **Carbendazim 50% WP:** 200-300 g/acre
*   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP:** 200-300 g/acre

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific product you are using, including dosage, timing, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer at HAU for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and prevailing disease pressure.
