Mites, including Red Spider Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mites (e.g., *Epitrimerus tabacinae*), can cause significant damage to tobacco crops in Haryana, leading to reduced yield and quality. An integrated approach is recommended for effective control.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mite Control in Tobacco:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues and weeds that can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as mites thrive in hot, dry conditions. Overhead irrigation can sometimes help dislodge mites.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, succulent growth favored by mites.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the pest cycle.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as predatory mites (*Amblyseius* spp.), ladybird beetles, and lacewings, which prey on mites. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   Apply acaricides when mite populations reach economic threshold levels. Ensure thorough coverage of both upper and lower leaf surfaces, as mites often reside on the underside of leaves.
    *   Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.
    *   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions.

    **CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Mite Control in Tobacco:**

    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Abamectin** 1.9% EC: Apply at 0.25 - 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Wettable Sulphur** 80% WP: Apply at 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. (Effective against rust mites and also suppresses red spider mites).
    *   **Fenpyroximate** 5% SC: Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Pyridaben** 10% WP: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 g per litre of water.

    *Note: The total spray volume per acre typically ranges from 400-600 litres, depending on crop canopy size. Adjust the total quantity of chemical accordingly (e.g., for 500 litres/acre, multiply the per litre dose by 500).*
