Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding "drying up" in tobacco plants. This symptom, encompassing drying branches, leaves, fruits (capsules), and flowers, can be indicative of various underlying issues, both biotic (diseases, pests) and abiotic (environmental, nutritional). Accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management.

Here's a comprehensive approach to address drying up in tobacco:

**I. Biotic Factors (Diseases)**

Several fungal and bacterial diseases can cause wilting and drying symptoms in tobacco.

1.  **Bacterial Wilt (Caused by *Ralstonia solanacearum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of leaves, often on one side of the plant, without initial yellowing. The pith of the stem, when cut, shows a brown to black discoloration, and a milky bacterial ooze may exude when a cut stem is placed in water.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops (e.g., cereals, maize) for at least 3-5 years.
            *   Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available for your region.
            *   Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.
            *   Improve soil drainage.
            *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of bacterial wilt.
            *   Soil solarization during hot summer months can reduce pathogen load.

2.  **Fusarium Wilt (Caused by *Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. nicotianae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of lower leaves, progressing upwards. The vascular tissue inside the stem shows brown streaks when cut. Plants may be stunted.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Use resistant varieties.
            *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
            *   Maintain good field sanitation.
            *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can exacerbate the disease.
        *   **Chemical Control (Soil Drench/Seed Treatment):**
            *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP): Apply as a soil drench at 1-2 g/L of water around the base of affected plants, or for seed treatment at 2 g/kg seed.
            *   **Thiophanate Methyl** (70% WP): Apply as a soil drench at 1-1.5 g/L of water.

3.  **Black Shank (Caused by *Phytophthora nicotianae*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Dark brown to black lesions develop on the stem at or below the soil line, leading to rapid wilting and collapse of the plant. Roots may be rotted.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Use resistant varieties.
            *   Ensure excellent soil drainage; avoid waterlogging.
            *   Crop rotation with non-host crops.
            *   Deep ploughing to bury infected plant debris.
        *   **Chemical Control (Soil Drench):**
            *   **Metalaxyl** (35% WS or 8% GR): Apply as a soil drench at 1-2 g/L of water or 1-2 kg/acre granular formulation incorporated into the soil.
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** (72.2% SL): Apply as a soil drench at 2-3 ml/L of water.

**II. Biotic Factors (Pests)**

1.  **Root-knot Nematodes (*Meloidogyne spp.*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, and wilting, especially during hot periods or water stress. Inspection of roots will reveal characteristic galls (swellings). Damaged roots impair water and nutrient uptake, leading to drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, cereals).
            *   Use of resistant varieties.
            *   Field sanitation and removal of infected plant debris.
            *   Soil solarization.
            *   Application of **Neem cake** at 200-400 kg/acre during field preparation.

2.  **Stem Borers (e.g., larvae of *Spodoptera litura*, *Helicoverpa armigera*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Wilting and drying of individual branches or the entire top portion of the plant due to larvae boring into the stem, disrupting water and nutrient flow. Entry/exit holes and frass may be visible.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural Practices:**
            *   Regular monitoring and manual removal of infested plants/stems.
            *   Use of pheromone traps to monitor adult moth populations.
        *   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC): 0.3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (5% SG): 0.5 g/L of water.

**III. Abiotic Factors (Environmental/Cultural)**

1.  **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging)**
    *   **Symptoms:**
        *   **Drought:** General wilting, leaf scorching, and drying, starting from lower leaves.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Yellowing, wilting, and drying due to root damage and suffocation.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Implement proper irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture and crop needs.
        *   Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging.
        *   Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.

2.  **Nutrient Deficiencies**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific patterns of yellowing, necrosis, and drying depending on the nutrient. For example, severe potassium deficiency can cause marginal scorching and drying of older leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct regular soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations and crop requirements.

3.  **Soil Salinity/Alkalinity**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, marginal leaf burn, wilting, and drying, especially under stress.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to assess salinity/alkalinity levels.
        *   For sodic soils, apply **Gypsum** as per recommendations.
        *   Leach salts with good quality irrigation water where feasible.

4.  **Herbicide Drift or Chemical Injury**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular patterns of necrosis, distortion, and drying on leaves and branches, often appearing suddenly.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when applying herbicides in nearby fields to prevent drift.
        *   Ensure proper calibration and application techniques for all pesticides.

**General Recommendations (Integrated Pest and Disease Management - IPDM):**

*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests and diseases.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use healthy, certified, disease-free seedlings.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Implement a well-planned crop rotation program to break disease and pest cycles.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients to enhance plant vigor and resistance.
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect your tobacco plants for early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.

Given the complexity of "drying up" symptoms, careful observation of specific patterns, affected plant parts, and internal stem/root conditions is essential for accurate diagnosis. If symptoms persist or worsen, please collect samples (whole plants showing symptoms, including roots and surrounding soil) and bring them to the Plant Pathology or Entomology department at HAU, Hisar, for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
