Namaste, Kisan bhaiyon! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing these pests in tobacco cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to monitor your fields regularly to identify pest infestations early and apply control measures promptly.

### 1. Control of Borers in Tobacco

Borers, particularly stem borers, can cause significant damage by tunneling into the stems, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and even plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for signs of borer entry holes or wilting.
    *   Remove and destroy affected plants or plant parts to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing crop residues.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence is high):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 88 g per acre (in 200-400 L water).

### 2. Control of Caterpillars in Tobacco

Caterpillars, such as the Tobacco caterpillar (*Spodoptera litura*) and American bollworm (*Helicoverpa armigera*), are major defoliating pests that can cause extensive damage to leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly monitor for egg masses and young larvae, especially on the underside of leaves. Hand-picking and destroying them can be effective in early stages and small areas.
    *   Use pheromone traps (e.g., for *Spodoptera litura*) for mass trapping of male moths to reduce population build-up.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Application of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations can be effective against young larvae. Follow product-specific recommendations for dosage.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence crosses economic threshold level):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 88 g per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Novaluron 10% EC:** 300 ml per acre (in 200-400 L water).

### 3. Diamondback Moth (DBM) in Tobacco

This is not known to affect Tobacco. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard, not tobacco.

### 4. Control of Leaf Folder in Tobacco

Leaf folders can cause damage by folding leaves and feeding from within the folds, reducing the photosynthetic area and quality of the leaves.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for folded leaves.
    *   Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae to reduce pest population.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest incidence is high):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** 50 g per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** 88 g per acre (in 200-400 L water).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** 200 ml per acre (in 200-400 L water).

**General Recommendations for Effective Pest Management:**

*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Always combine cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest control.
*   **Pesticide Label:** Always read the label of the pesticide carefully before use and strictly follow the instructions regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval, and safety precautions.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough and uniform spray coverage for effective control.
*   **Consult Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest situation, always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
