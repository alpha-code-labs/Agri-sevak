As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Tobacco cultivation in Haryana. These recommendations are general and should always be adjusted based on a comprehensive soil test report from a certified laboratory, the specific tobacco variety, and the intended use of the tobacco.

**General NPK Recommendations for Tobacco (per acre):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 40-60 kg/acre
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 20-30 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 40-60 kg/acre (For quality leaf tobacco, **Sulphate of Potash** is highly preferred over **Muriate of Potash** to avoid chloride toxicity which can impair leaf burn quality).
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-15 kg/acre

**Recommended Doses of Specific Fertilizers (per acre):**

*   **Urea:**
    *   Apply 80-120 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   Nitrogen should be applied in split doses:
        *   1/3rd as basal application.
        *   1/3rd at 30-40 days after transplanting.
        *   1/3rd at 50-60 days after transplanting (or before topping).

*   **Nano-Urea:**
    *   As a supplementary foliar spray: 2-4 ml of **Nano-Urea** per litre of water.
    *   Apply at critical growth stages, typically 30-45 days after transplanting, and again 15-20 days later. This is a supplement and not a replacement for conventional basal nitrogen application.

*   **DAP (Diammonium Phosphate):**
    *   Apply 45-65 kg **DAP** per acre as a basal application at the time of transplanting. This will supply a portion of the Nitrogen and the majority of the Phosphorus requirement.

*   **Nano-DAP:**
    *   As a supplementary foliar spray: 2-4 ml of **Nano-DAP** per litre of water.
    *   Apply at critical growth stages, such as pre-flowering and early pod development, to boost phosphorus availability.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   If using a complex NPK fertilizer, the dose will depend on the specific ratio (e.g., 10:26:26, 12:32:16, 19:19:19).
    *   For example, 150-200 kg of **NPK (10:26:26)** per acre can be used as a basal dose, but ensure it meets the N, P, K requirements and consider the chloride content if using for quality leaf tobacco. It is generally recommended to use straight fertilizers for precise nutrient management in tobacco.

*   **SSP (Single Superphosphate):**
    *   As an alternative to DAP for Phosphorus and Sulphur: Apply 125-190 kg **SSP** per acre as a basal application. This will provide the required Phosphorus and a significant portion of Sulphur.

*   **Potash (Potassium):**
    *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP):** For quality leaf tobacco, apply 80-120 kg **Sulphate of Potash** per acre as a basal application. This provides Potassium and Sulphur without chloride.
    *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** If **Sulphate of Potash** is not available or for tobacco types where burn quality is not a primary concern, apply 65-100 kg **Muriate of Potash** per acre as a basal application. However, be cautious of chloride content.

*   **Sulphur:**
    *   If the Sulphur requirement is not adequately met by **SSP** or **Sulphate of Potash**, apply 10-15 kg **Elemental Sulphur** (90% WDG) per acre as a basal application.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying fertilizers to determine the exact nutrient status of your field and tailor the recommendations accordingly.
*   **Chloride Sensitivity:** For high-quality tobacco (e.g., flue-cured, bidi), avoid chloride-containing fertilizers like **Muriate of Potash** as chloride can negatively impact leaf burn quality. Prefer **Sulphate of Potash**.
*   **Micronutrients:** Based on soil test results, apply micronutrients like Boron, Zinc, Manganese, and Iron if deficiencies are identified.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes/acre) can significantly improve soil health and nutrient availability.
