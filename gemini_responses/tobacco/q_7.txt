As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Tobacco, keeping in mind the conditions prevalent in Haryana:

**Understanding Dieback and Twig Blight in Tobacco:**

"Dieback" and "Twig Blight" are general terms describing symptoms of various underlying issues, rather than specific diseases themselves. These symptoms, characterized by the progressive death of twigs and branches from the tip downwards (dieback) or rapid browning and death of twigs (blight), can be caused by fungal pathogens, bacterial infections, nutrient deficiencies, water stress, or other environmental factors. In tobacco, common fungal pathogens that can lead to such symptoms include:

*   *Phytophthora nicotianae* (causing Black Shank, which can lead to stem and twig death)
*   *Colletotrichum tabacum* (Anthracnose, causing stem lesions)
*   *Alternaria alternata* (Brown Spot, which can affect stems and leaves)
*   *Rhizoctonia solani* (causing Sore Shin or damping-off, affecting the lower stem)

Effective management requires identifying the specific cause, but general strategies for managing these symptoms, primarily when fungal pathogens are suspected, include:

**1. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice rotation with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years to break the disease cycle.
*   **Proper Drainage:** Ensure good field drainage to prevent waterlogging, which favors many fungal pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients to enhance plant vigor and resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible.
*   **Optimal Spacing:** Maintain recommended plant spacing to ensure good air circulation, reducing humidity around plants.
*   **Use of Healthy Seedlings:** Plant only healthy, disease-free seedlings.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

If fungal pathogens are identified or strongly suspected as the cause of dieback or twig blight, the following CIBRC approved fungicides can be considered. Always consult your local agricultural extension officer for precise dosage and timing based on specific field conditions and disease severity.

*   **For broad-spectrum fungal control (e.g., *Alternaria*, *Colletotrichum*):**
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).
    *   Foliar spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 0.5-1.0 kg per acre (or 1.0 g/L of water).
    *   Foliar spray with **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 200 ml per acre (or 0.5 ml/L of water).

*   **For Oomycete pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora* causing Black Shank):**
    *   Foliar spray or drench with **Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP** at 2.0-2.5 kg per acre (or 2.5 g/L of water).

*   **For *Rhizoctonia* (if causing sore shin/stem rot leading to blight):**
    *   Drenching with **Validamycin 3% L** at 2.0-2.5 L per acre (or 2.0-2.5 ml/L of water).

**Tikka Disease in Tobacco:**

This is not known to affect Tobacco. Tikka disease is a well-known fungal disease primarily affecting groundnut (peanut) crops, caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.
