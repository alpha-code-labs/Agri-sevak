Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in tobacco cultivation in Haryana. Both these pests can significantly impact tobacco yield and quality.

### **1. Control of Termites (Odontotermes spp., Microtermes spp.) in Tobacco**

Termites can cause severe damage by feeding on the roots and stem base of tobacco plants, leading to wilting, stunted growth, and ultimately plant death.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight by deep ploughing during summer.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer moist conditions and are less active in waterlogged areas.

**Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
For effective control, apply chemicals as a pre-plant treatment or drench at transplanting.
*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply 2.5 - 4.0 L per acre mixed with sufficient water (e.g., 400-500 L) as a soil drench or incorporate into the soil before planting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or as a band application at transplanting.
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply 125-250 ml per acre as a soil drench around the root zone of plants at transplanting.

### **2. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) in Tobacco**

Root-knot nematodes are a major problem in tobacco, causing characteristic galls or knots on the roots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, reduced leaf size, and significant yield and quality losses.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate tobacco with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, pearl millet) or marigold for at least 2-3 years. Avoid solanaceous crops (tomato, potato, brinjal) as they are also hosts.
*   **Solarization:** Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during hot summer months (4-6 weeks) to raise soil temperature and kill nematodes.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) into the soil, which can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for your region, choose tobacco varieties resistant to common root-knot nematode species.

**Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
Apply nematicides as a pre-plant treatment or at transplanting.
*   **Carbosulfan 25% EC:** Apply 2.0 L per acre as a pre-plant soil drench or incorporate into the soil before transplanting.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR:** Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before planting or as a band application at transplanting. (Note: This provides dual action against termites and some nematode species).
*   **Oxamyl 24% SL:** Apply 2.0 - 4.0 L per acre as a soil drench at planting or post-planting around the root zone.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always conduct a soil test to confirm the presence and population density of nematodes before applying nematicides.
*   Follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions strictly when handling and applying any chemical.
*   An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is most effective for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
