Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for healthy tobacco cultivation. Macro-nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact yield and quality.

Before any application, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test to accurately determine the existing nutrient levels and tailor the recommendations precisely. This will prevent over-application and ensure efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies in Tobacco:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf expansion, and chlorophyll production.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, small and pale green leaves.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (for sustained supply):**
        *   Apply **Urea** at 50-100 kg/acre in split doses, typically 2-3 weeks after transplanting and again 4-6 weeks after transplanting, depending on soil test results and crop stage.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium ammonium nitrate** at 100-200 kg/acre in split doses.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Urea** solution at 10-20 g/L of water (1-2% solution). Apply in the early morning or late evening to avoid leaf scorch. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, energy transfer, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, particularly on the underside, delayed maturity.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (basal application is most effective):**
        *   Apply **Di-ammonium phosphate (DAP)** at 50-100 kg/acre as a basal dose during land preparation or at transplanting.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Single superphosphate (SSP)** at 150-250 kg/acre as a basal dose.
    *   **Foliar Application (for immediate, temporary relief):**
        *   Spray **Monoammonium phosphate (MAP)** solution at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, and significantly impacts the burning quality and aroma of tobacco leaves.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and scorching (necrosis) of leaf margins, especially on older leaves, starting from the tips and progressing inwards. Leaves may appear crinkled or puckered.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (basal or split application):**
        *   Apply **Muriate of potash (Potassium chloride)** at 40-80 kg/acre, either as a basal dose or in split applications.
        *   Alternatively, apply **Sulphate of potash (Potassium sulphate)** at 50-100 kg/acre. Sulphate of potash is often preferred for tobacco due to its positive impact on leaf quality.
    *   **Foliar Application (for quick correction):**
        *   Spray **Potassium nitrate** solution at 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Sulphate of potash** solution at 5-10 g/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing:** Basal applications of Phosphorus and Potassium are generally most effective as these nutrients are less mobile in the soil. Nitrogen is often applied in split doses to match crop demand and minimize losses.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate soil moisture for efficient nutrient uptake.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (e.g., well-decomposed farmyard manure) to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Soil pH:** Ensure the soil pH is within the optimal range (typically 5.5-6.5 for tobacco) for maximum nutrient availability.

Always follow the specific recommendations based on your soil test report and local agricultural extension guidelines for the best results.
