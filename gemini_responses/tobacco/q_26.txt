As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices in Tobacco cultivation:

### Specialized Practices in Tobacco

**1. Pruning (Topping)**

In tobacco, pruning is specifically referred to as 'Topping'.
*   **Purpose:** Topping involves the removal of the terminal flower bud and a few small leaves below it. This practice diverts the plant's energy and nutrients from flower and seed production towards the development of larger, thicker, and higher-quality leaves. It also promotes uniform ripening of the leaves and increases nicotine content.
*   **Method:** The terminal bud is typically snapped off by hand when it reaches the 'button' stage (just before flowering) or when the first few flowers appear. The height of topping (number of leaves left on the plant) depends on the tobacco type, variety, soil fertility, and desired leaf quality. For example, flue-cured tobacco is often topped higher than bidi tobacco.
*   **Timing:** Usually done 40-60 days after transplanting, depending on the variety and growth conditions.

**2. Desuckering (De-suckering)**

*   **Purpose:** After topping, axillary buds (suckers) emerge from the leaf axils. These suckers compete with the main leaves for water and nutrients, reducing leaf size, thickness, and overall quality. Desuckering is the removal of these suckers to ensure maximum nutrient allocation to the desired leaves.
*   **Method:**
    *   **Manual Desuckering:** Suckers are removed by hand as they emerge, typically every 7-10 days, requiring multiple rounds. This is labor-intensive but ensures complete removal.
    *   **Chemical Desuckering:** This method uses suckericides to inhibit or kill sucker growth, reducing labor costs.
        *   **Contact Suckericides:** These chemicals kill suckers on contact. They are typically applied as an emulsion spray, ensuring good coverage of the leaf axils.
            *   **n-Decanol** (e.g., 60-80 ml/10 L water, applied per acre)
            *   **n-Octanol** (often used in combination with n-Decanol)
        *   **Systemic Suckericides:** These chemicals are absorbed by the plant and translocated to inhibit sucker growth.
            *   **Maleic Hydrazide** (MH) (e.g., 2.5-3.0 kg/acre, diluted in 200-300 L water, applied as a fine spray over the top leaves and axils)
            *   **Flumetralin** (e.g., 1.0-1.5 L/acre, diluted in 200-300 L water, applied as a fine spray)
*   **Timing:** Chemical suckericides are usually applied immediately after topping, ensuring the solution drips down into the leaf axils. Manual desuckering follows as needed.

**3. Mulching**

*   **Purpose:** Mulching involves covering the soil surface around the tobacco plants with organic or synthetic materials. While not a universally adopted practice for all tobacco types in Haryana, it can offer several benefits:
    *   **Moisture Conservation:** Reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving soil moisture, especially beneficial in rainfed areas or during dry spells.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** Blocks sunlight, inhibiting weed germination and growth, thereby reducing competition for nutrients and water.
    *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Helps to moderate soil temperature, keeping it cooler in hot weather and warmer in cooler periods.
    *   **Soil Health:** Organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves) decompose over time, adding organic matter and improving soil structure.
*   **Method:** Organic mulches are spread around the base of the plants after establishment. Plastic mulches (black or clear polyethylene films) can be laid before transplanting, with holes punched for the seedlings.

**4. Grafting**

*   **This is not known to affect Tobacco as a commercial practice.** Grafting is not a standard or specialized practice in commercial tobacco cultivation. Tobacco is typically propagated from seeds. While grafting might be used in research settings (e.g., for studying disease resistance or nutrient uptake), it is not employed by farmers for commercial leaf production.

**5. Pollination**

*   **This is not known to affect Tobacco as a specialized practice.** Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is primarily a self-pollinating crop. Its flowers are perfect (containing both male and female reproductive organs), and self-pollination occurs readily, often before the flower fully opens. Therefore, no specialized pollination practices (like hand pollination or reliance on specific pollinators) are required for commercial tobacco production, as the focus is on leaf yield rather than seed production. Even for seed production, natural self-pollination is highly efficient.
