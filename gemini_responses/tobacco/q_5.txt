As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the conditions you've mentioned for Tobacco cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Scab:** This is not known to affect Tobacco.
*   **Canker:** This is not known to affect Tobacco.
*   **Gummosis:** This is not known to affect Tobacco.
*   **Lichen:** This is not known to affect Tobacco.

These conditions are generally not recognized as diseases or pests of tobacco that cause economic damage or require specific control measures in tobacco cultivation.
