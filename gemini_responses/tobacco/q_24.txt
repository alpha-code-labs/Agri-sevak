As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for tobacco transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time, Distance, and Process for Tobacco

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
*   The optimal period for transplanting tobacco seedlings in Haryana is from **late October to mid-November**. This timing allows the crop to establish well before the peak winter cold and mature before the onset of intense summer heat, ensuring good growth and yield.
*   Seedlings are typically ready for transplanting when they are 6-8 weeks old and have attained a height of 10-15 cm with 4-5 true leaves.

**2. Ideal Transplantation Distance:**
*   The spacing can vary slightly depending on the specific tobacco variety (e.g., chewing, hookah) and desired leaf size, but a general recommendation for Haryana conditions is:
    *   **Row-to-Row Distance:** 60-75 cm
    *   **Plant-to-Plant Distance:** 45-60 cm
*   This spacing allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and nutrient uptake, which are crucial for healthy plant development and disease prevention.

**3. Ideal Transplantation Process:**
*   **Nursery Preparation:** Ensure seedlings are healthy, vigorous, and free from pests and diseases. Harden off seedlings by gradually reducing water and exposing them to outdoor conditions for a few days before transplanting to minimize transplant shock.
*   **Field Preparation:** The main field should be well-prepared, thoroughly ploughed, harrowed, and leveled. Ensure good drainage and incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure or compost during field preparation.
*   **Marking:** Mark the rows and plant positions accurately using a rope or marker to maintain uniform spacing.
*   **Timing of Transplant:** Transplanting should ideally be done in the late afternoon or on a cloudy day to reduce stress on the seedlings from direct sunlight.
*   **Method:**
    *   Dig small holes at the marked positions.
    *   Carefully remove seedlings from the nursery bed, ensuring minimal damage to the root system.
    *   Place one seedling per hole, ensuring the roots are spread out and not bent.
    *   Plant the seedling to the same depth as it was in the nursery, or slightly deeper if the stem is leggy.
    *   Firmly press the soil around the base of the seedling to ensure good root-to-soil contact and remove air pockets.
*   **Immediate Irrigation:** Light irrigation immediately after transplanting is crucial for the establishment of the seedlings. This helps settle the soil around the roots and provides initial moisture.
*   **Gap Filling:** Monitor the transplanted field for 5-7 days. Replant any dead, damaged, or unhealthy seedlings (gap filling) to maintain the desired plant population and ensure uniform crop stand.
