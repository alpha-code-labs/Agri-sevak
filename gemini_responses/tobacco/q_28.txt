As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the critical importance of protecting tobacco crops from environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana. Here's scientifically verified advice to mitigate the impact of extreme cold, frost, heat/loo, and intense sunlight on tobacco:

### Protecting Tobacco from Environmental Stress

**1. Extreme Cold and Frost:**

Tobacco is sensitive to cold and frost, especially during its early growth stages.
*   **Irrigation:** Apply light irrigation to the field in the late afternoon or early evening before an anticipated frost. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat as it freezes, keeping the soil and air around the plants warmer.
*   **Covering:** For nurseries or small plots, use straw, dry grass, or plastic sheets to cover young plants during frosty nights. Remove covers during the day.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant shelterbelts (e.g., fast-growing trees) around fields to reduce the impact of cold winds.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate potassium (K) nutrition. Potassium plays a vital role in osmoregulation and improving plant tolerance to cold stress.
*   **Foliar Applications:**
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Foliar spray at 10-15 g/L of water, applied a few days before an anticipated cold wave, can enhance cold tolerance.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Foliar spray at 1-2 g/L of water. Glycine betaine acts as an osmoprotectant, helping cells maintain turgor and function under stress.
    *   **Potassium Humate:** Foliar spray at 2-3 ml/L or 2-3 g/L of water. Improves nutrient uptake and overall plant vigor, enhancing stress resilience.

**2. Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight:**

High temperatures and hot, dry winds (Loo) can cause wilting, scorching, and reduced growth in tobacco. Intense sunlight can also lead to sunburn.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain optimal soil moisture through regular irrigation, especially during peak heat periods. This helps in evaporative cooling and prevents wilting.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (e.g., straw, crop residues) around the base of plants. Mulch helps to reduce soil temperature, conserve moisture, and suppress weeds.
*   **Shade Nets:** For nurseries or young transplants, consider using 30-50% shade nets during the hottest parts of the day or season to reduce direct sun exposure and temperature.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish windbreaks to reduce the desiccating effect of hot winds.
*   **Foliar Applications:**
    *   **Kaolin:** Spray a 5-6% solution (50-60 g/L of water) of **Kaolin** clay. It forms a white reflective film on leaves, reducing leaf temperature by reflecting sunlight and decreasing transpiration. Reapply after heavy rains.
    *   **Potassium Nitrate:** Foliar spray at 10-15 g/L of water. Potassium helps in stomatal regulation and water balance, improving heat tolerance.
    *   **Glycine Betaine:** Foliar spray at 1-2 g/L of water to help plants cope with osmotic stress induced by heat and drought.
    *   **Salicylic Acid:** Foliar spray at 0.5-1 mM (approximately 0.07-0.14 g/L of water). Salicylic acid is a plant hormone that plays a role in systemic acquired resistance and stress tolerance, including heat stress.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always ensure proper spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Consult local agricultural extension services for specific timing and dosage recommendations based on your tobacco variety and local conditions.
*   An integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of approved chemicals yields the best results.
