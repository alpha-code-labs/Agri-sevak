As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in Tobacco, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective management.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Tobacco:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds and volunteer plants that can act as alternate hosts for pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of tobacco or other solanaceous crops in the same field.
    *   **Timely Planting:** Plant tobacco at the recommended time to avoid peak pest infestations.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can lead to lush growth, making plants more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and growing points, for early detection of pests. Use yellow sticky traps (10-12 traps/acre) for monitoring whiteflies and winged aphids.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Conserve natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:**

    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 40-50 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-100 g per acre
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: 60 g per acre (Highly effective against aphids and whiteflies)
    *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC: 125 ml per acre (Effective against whiteflies and thrips, also controls mites)
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 600-800 ml per acre (Insect growth regulator, effective against whitefly nymphs and hoppers)
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP: 250 g per acre (Effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites)
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml per acre (Good for thrips and leafhoppers)
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 100-125 ml per acre (Effective against thrips, leafhoppers, and aphids)
    *   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 660 ml per acre (Effective against aphids and leafhoppers)

    **For Psylla:**
    Psylla is not a common major pest of tobacco in Haryana. However, if observed, the insecticides recommended for other sucking pests like **Imidacloprid**, **Thiamethoxam**, or **Acetamiprid** would generally be effective.

    **Application Details:**
    *   For all foliar sprays, use 200-250 litres of water per acre to ensure thorough coverage of the plant canopy.
    *   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and spraying chemicals.
*   Adhere strictly to the pre-harvest interval (PHI) mentioned on the insecticide label to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, please consult with your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist.
