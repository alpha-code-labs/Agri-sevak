As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) to ensure vigorous growth and maximize its benefits as a green manure crop, thereby improving overall soil health and fertility for subsequent crops.

**Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Dhaincha:**

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Dose:** 5-10 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Incorporate thoroughly into the soil during land preparation, approximately 2-3 weeks before sowing Dhaincha. This provides a broad spectrum of nutrients and significantly improves soil structure and microbial activity.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply and mix into the soil at the time of final land preparation or sowing. Vermicompost is richer in readily available nutrients and beneficial microbes compared to FYM, promoting early vigor and establishment of Dhaincha.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Note:** While not a bulk manure like FYM or vermicompost, **Sagarika** is an organic biostimulant derived from seaweed extract that enhances plant growth, nutrient uptake, and stress tolerance.
    *   **Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** 1-2 litres per acre.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Foliar:** Apply the first spray 15-20 days after sowing, and a second spray 30-40 days after sowing.
        *   **Soil:** Can be applied at sowing or during early growth stages through irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   The specific doses can be adjusted based on soil test results and the existing organic matter content of your field.
*   Ensuring proper decomposition of FYM and vermicompost before incorporation is crucial to avoid nutrient immobilization.
*   The primary benefit of growing Dhaincha is its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and add significant organic matter to the soil when incorporated. Applying these organic manures helps ensure a robust Dhaincha crop, maximizing these benefits for the subsequent main crop.
