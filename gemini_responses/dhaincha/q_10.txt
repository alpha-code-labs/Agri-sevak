As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana.

It is important to note that Dhaincha is primarily grown as a green manure crop, and significant pest outbreaks that warrant chemical intervention are rare. The crop is generally robust, and minor defoliation usually does not impact its primary purpose of biomass production for soil enrichment. Chemical application should be considered only in cases of severe infestation, especially if the crop is being grown for seed production.

Here's the specific advice for each pest:

*   **Borers:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **Diamondback moth:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha.

For **Caterpillars** and **Leaf folders**:

While general caterpillars and leaf folders can occasionally feed on Dhaincha leaves, they rarely cause economically significant damage, especially when the crop is grown for green manure. Natural enemies usually keep their populations in check.

**Management Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Timely Sowing and Incorporation:** Ensure timely sowing and incorporation of Dhaincha into the soil before it matures too much, which can help break the pest life cycle.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds and crop residues that can harbor pests.

2.  **Chemical Control (Only if absolutely necessary for severe outbreaks, e.g., for seed production):**
    If the infestation is severe and threatens the biomass production or seed yield, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be considered for lepidopteran pests in legumes:

    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** 60 ml per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** 80-100 g per acre (mixed in 200-300 litres of water).

Always ensure proper spray coverage and follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (though not typically relevant for green manure).
