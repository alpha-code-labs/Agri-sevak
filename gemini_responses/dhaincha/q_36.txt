Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) is primarily cultivated in Haryana as a green manure crop to enrich soil fertility, improve soil structure, and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Its main 'yield' is biomass for incorporation into the soil, rather than 'fruit' for consumption or 'storage life' of a harvested product in the conventional sense. However, if you are referring to **seed quality** and **seed storage life** for future sowing, the following advice is relevant.

### To Improve Biomass Yield (for Green Manure):

*   **Variety Selection:** Use locally adapted, high-biomass producing varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.
*   **Sowing Time:** Optimal sowing is from April to July, coinciding with pre-monsoon or monsoon rains, allowing for sufficient growth before incorporation.
*   **Seed Rate:** Use a seed rate of 20-25 kg/acre for a dense stand, which maximizes biomass production and weed suppression.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Essential for robust root development and efficient nitrogen fixation by root nodules. Apply 20-25 kg P2O5/acre (e.g., through Single Super Phosphate).
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 10-15 kg K2O/acre if soil tests indicate a deficiency, as it contributes to overall plant health and stress tolerance.
    *   **Micronutrients:** If soil tests show deficiency, apply **Zinc sulphate** (21%) at 10 kg/acre or **Borax** (10.5%) at 2 kg/acre.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate moisture, especially during establishment and early growth phases. While Dhaincha is relatively drought-tolerant once established, consistent moisture promotes vigorous growth.
*   **Weed Control:** Initial weed control (first 20-30 days after sowing) can significantly boost biomass accumulation by reducing competition for nutrients and water. Manual weeding is often sufficient.
*   **Timely Incorporation:** Incorporate the green manure into the soil 45-60 days after sowing, preferably before flowering, to maximize nutrient release and decomposition benefits to the subsequent crop.

### Regarding Fruit Quality and Storage Life:

As Dhaincha is primarily a green manure crop, "fruit quality" (pods for consumption) and "storage life" (of pods/seeds as a consumable product) are generally not relevant. However, if you are referring to **Seed Quality** and **Seed Storage Life** for future sowing, the following points are crucial:

### To Improve Seed Quality (if grown for seed production):

*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition, especially during flowering and pod development stages. Adequate Phosphorus and Potassium are vital for good seed set and development.
*   **Pest Management:** Protect developing pods from pests that can damage seeds.
    *   For pod borers, if infestation is severe, consider spraying **Chlorantraniliprole** at 0.4 ml/L or **Indoxacarb** at 0.5 ml/L.
*   **Disease Management:** Dhaincha is generally robust against most diseases. Specific fungal diseases affecting pods/seeds are rare, but if observed, a broad-spectrum fungicide like **Carbendazim** at 1 g/L might be considered.
*   **Harvesting:** Harvest pods when they are physiologically mature and dry, but before excessive shattering occurs, to minimize seed loss.
*   **Drying:** Thoroughly dry harvested pods/seeds to reduce moisture content, which is critical for maintaining seed viability.

### To Improve Seed Storage Life (for future sowing):

*   **Moisture Content:** Dry seeds to 8-10% moisture content before storage. Higher moisture content significantly reduces viability and promotes pest/fungal growth.
*   **Storage Conditions:** Store seeds in cool, dry, well-ventilated, and airtight containers (e.g., metal bins, thick plastic bags) to protect them from moisture fluctuations and pests.
*   **Pest Control:** Protect stored seeds from storage pests like pulse beetles (Callosobruchus spp.).
    *   For large quantities, fumigation with **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets per tonne of seed for 7 days) can be done in airtight conditions by trained personnel, strictly following safety guidelines.
    *   For smaller quantities, mixing inert dusts like neem seed kernel powder or specific insecticidal dusts (e.g., **Malathion** dust 5% at 1 kg/100 kg seed) can be used, ensuring proper safety precautions and uniform mixing.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically check stored seeds for signs of moisture absorption, pest infestation, or fungal growth. Take corrective measures promptly if any issues are detected.
