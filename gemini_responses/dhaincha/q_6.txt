As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana.

It is crucial to understand that once a plant is infected with a virus, there is no chemical cure. Therefore, control strategies focus primarily on prevention and managing the insect vectors that transmit these viruses.

Regarding the specific diseases mentioned:

*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha. Tristeza virus primarily affects citrus species.
*   **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha. Stripe viruses are typically associated with monocot crops like maize or sugarcane.

For Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus, which are general viral symptoms that can affect various legume crops including Dhaincha, the control measures are as follows:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Primary Control Measures):**

1.  **Use Healthy Seeds:** Always use disease-free, certified seeds or seeds from healthy plants to prevent seed-borne viral transmission.
2.  **Roguing:** Regularly inspect the field and promptly remove and destroy (bury or burn) any plants showing symptoms of viral infection. This prevents the spread of the virus to healthy plants.
3.  **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the Dhaincha field, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors.
4.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-leguminous crops to break the disease cycle.
5.  **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sow Dhaincha at the recommended time to avoid periods of high insect vector activity.
6.  **Field Sanitation:** Maintain good field hygiene to reduce potential sources of infection.

**II. Vector Management (Chemical Control):**

Viral diseases are primarily transmitted by insect vectors such as whiteflies (for Leaf curl, Yellow vein clearing) and aphids (for Mosaic, Stunt viruses). Controlling these vectors is key to preventing the spread of the virus. Apply insecticides only when vector populations reach economic threshold levels.

**A. For Whiteflies (Vectors for Leaf Curl, Yellow Vein Clearing):**

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-100 g per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-100 g per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 600-800 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.

**B. For Aphids (Vectors for Mosaic, Stunt Viruses):**

*   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-100 g per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Dimethoate** 30% EC: 330-500 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.
*   **Methyl Demeton** 25% EC: 400 ml per acre, diluted in 200-300 litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the insecticide label for safe and effective use, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in insect populations.
*   Consider the economic viability of chemical control, especially for a green manure crop like Dhaincha. Prioritize cultural practices.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and current pest pressure.
