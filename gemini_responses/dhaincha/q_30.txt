Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on managing growth issues in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata), primarily grown as a green manure crop in Haryana. The goal for Dhaincha as green manure is typically rapid vegetative growth and high biomass accumulation for nitrogen fixation and soil improvement.

Here's how to manage the described growth issues:

### General Recommendations:
*   **Soil Testing:** Always begin with a comprehensive soil test. This is crucial for identifying specific nutrient deficiencies, soil pH imbalances, and other factors that might be limiting growth.
*   **Quality Seed:** Use certified, high-quality seeds for optimal germination and vigor.
*   **Rhizobium Inoculation:** Ensure proper inoculation with an effective *Rhizobium* strain, especially if Dhaincha has not been grown in the field recently or if the soil is poor.

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Dhaincha can be indicative of various underlying issues.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Crucial for root development and effective nodulation (nitrogen fixation). Apply **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** at 40-60 kg P2O5 per acre or **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** at 20-30 kg P2O5 per acre, based on soil test recommendations, at the time of sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Essential for overall plant vigor and stress tolerance. If soil test indicates deficiency, apply **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** at 20-30 kg K2O per acre.
    *   **Micronutrients:** Deficiencies of Zinc (Zn) or Iron (Fe) can also stunt growth.
        *   For Zinc deficiency, apply **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) at 10 kg per acre as a basal application, or a foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate** (5 g/L water) if symptoms appear.
        *   For Iron deficiency, apply **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 10 kg per acre as a basal application, or a foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) with a sticker.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, especially during the initial establishment phase. While Dhaincha is tolerant to waterlogging, extreme drought can severely limit growth.
*   **Soil Health:**
    *   **Soil Compaction:** Address soil compaction through tillage practices.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate farmyard manure (FYM) or compost to improve soil structure and nutrient availability.
    *   **Soil pH:** For highly alkaline soils, apply **Gypsum** as per soil test recommendations to improve soil conditions.
*   **Weed Competition:** Control weeds, especially during the early stages, as they compete for nutrients, water, and light.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) indicates a nutrient deficiency or stress.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** While Dhaincha fixes its own nitrogen, initial yellowing can occur if nodulation is poor or delayed.
    *   Ensure effective *Rhizobium* inoculation.
    *   In very poor soils, a starter dose of 10-15 kg N per acre (e.g., 20-30 kg **Urea**) can be applied at sowing to support early growth until nodules become active.
    *   Check roots for pinkish-red nodules, indicating active nitrogen fixation.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency:** Common in alkaline or calcareous soils, causing interveinal yellowing on younger leaves while veins remain green.
    *   Foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% **Ferrous Sulphate** (5-10 g/L water) with a sticker. Repeat after 7-10 days if symptoms persist.
*   **Sulphur (S) Deficiency:** Can cause general yellowing, often on younger leaves.
    *   Apply **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate) at 100-200 kg per acre or **Elemental Sulphur** at 10-20 kg per acre, based on soil test.
*   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Can cause yellowing, especially on younger leaves, and stunted growth.
    *   Foliar spray of 0.5% **Zinc Sulphate** (5 g/L water).
*   **Waterlogging:** Prolonged waterlogging can damage roots and impair nutrient uptake, leading to yellowing. Ensure proper drainage if this is the cause.

### 3. Excessive Height

For Dhaincha grown as green manure, "excessive height" generally translates to more biomass, which is desirable. However, if it leads to lodging before incorporation or makes mechanical incorporation difficult due to woody stems, it can be managed.

*   **Timely Incorporation:** The most effective management strategy is to incorporate the Dhaincha crop into the soil at the optimal stage, which is typically 45-60 days after sowing, or when it reaches peak vegetative growth but before it becomes too woody or flowers extensively. This ensures maximum succulent biomass and nitrogen content for the subsequent crop.
*   **Plant Density:** Ensure optimal plant spacing. Very high plant density can lead to etiolation (stretching for light), resulting in taller, thinner stems.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, especially if the soil is already fertile, as this can promote overly lush vegetative growth.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** Plant growth regulators are generally **not recommended or necessary** for Dhaincha grown as green manure, as the primary objective is biomass accumulation. Using PGRs to reduce height would be counterproductive to its main purpose.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

For Dhaincha grown as green manure, excessive or premature flowering is an issue because it indicates maturity, leading to an increased C:N ratio and lignification (woodiness) of stems. This reduces the quality of the green manure, making it decompose slower and release nitrogen less readily.

*   **Timely Incorporation:** This is the most critical management strategy. Incorporate Dhaincha into the soil at 45-60 days after sowing, or when it reaches peak vegetative growth but before extensive flowering. This ensures maximum succulent biomass and nitrogen content, which is ideal for green manuring.
*   **Avoid Stress:** Ensure adequate water and nutrient availability throughout the vegetative growth phase. Stress (e.g., drought, severe nutrient deficiency) can sometimes induce premature flowering as a survival mechanism.
*   **Variety Selection:** If available, choose Dhaincha varieties known for good vegetative growth and delayed flowering when grown for green manure purposes.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** Plant growth regulators to delay flowering are generally **not a standard practice** for Dhaincha grown as green manure. The most practical and effective approach is timely incorporation.

By following these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage growth issues in Dhaincha and maximize its benefits as a green manure crop in Haryana.
