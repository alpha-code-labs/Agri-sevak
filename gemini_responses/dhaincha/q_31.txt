As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that the conditions you've described – Fruit bursting, Leaf burning/melting, and Hardness in fruit – are **not known to affect Dhaincha** in a manner that requires specific control measures, especially considering its primary use as a green manure crop.

Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata / Sesbania rostrata) is predominantly cultivated for its biomass to be incorporated into the soil, improving soil fertility and structure. It is typically harvested and ploughed under before significant pod (fruit) development or maturity. Therefore, issues related to fruit quality (bursting, hardness) or specific leaf damage (burning/melting) are not considered significant problems in its cultivation for green manure.

While environmental stresses like extreme heat or drought can cause general leaf scorching or wilting in any crop, "leaf burning/melting" as a distinct, widespread problem requiring specific chemical or cultural controls is not characteristic of Dhaincha. Similarly, "fruit bursting" and "hardness in fruit" are quality concerns primarily for crops grown for their edible fruits, which is not the case for Dhaincha.
