As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones for Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana:

1.  **Ethrel (Ethephon)**
    *   **Ethephon** is primarily used for fruit ripening, flower induction, or plant height reduction in various crops. Its application as a growth regulator for Dhaincha, which is primarily grown as a green manure crop for biomass accumulation and nitrogen fixation, is not a standard practice.
    *   This is not known to affect Dhaincha in a beneficial growth-regulating manner for its intended purpose as a green manure crop.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin widely used as a selective herbicide for broadleaf weeds. Dhaincha itself is a broadleaf legume. Applying 2,4-D at herbicidal doses would damage or kill Dhaincha. While auxins are plant hormones, 2,4-D is not recommended or used as a growth regulator to enhance Dhaincha's growth for green manure purposes.
    *   This is not known to affect Dhaincha in a beneficial growth-regulating manner.

3.  **Boron**
    *   Boron is an essential micronutrient crucial for various physiological processes, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and seed development. While not a hormone, adequate boron supply is vital for healthy plant growth and vigor, especially in legumes like Dhaincha, which can indirectly regulate growth and biomass production.
    *   **Recommended Dose (Foliar Application):**
        *   **Chemical Name:** **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor).
        *   **Dose:** Prepare a 0.1% to 0.2% solution. This translates to **1-2 g/L** of water.
        *   **Application Rate:** Spray 200-250 L of this solution per acre.
        *   **Timing:** Apply during the active vegetative growth stage, or if visual symptoms of boron deficiency (e.g., stunted growth, abnormal leaf development) are observed. This ensures optimal plant health and biomass accumulation for green manuring.
