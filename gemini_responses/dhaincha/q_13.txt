This is not known to affect Dhaincha.

Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/Sesbania rostrata) is primarily cultivated as a green manure crop for soil improvement. Fruit fly (Bactrocera spp.) and Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana) are pests that specifically target the fruits of various horticultural crops. Dhaincha is not a fruit-bearing crop in the context that these pests would infest it, and therefore, control measures for these pests are not relevant for Dhaincha cultivation.
