As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Wilt and Parawilt in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) for Haryana.

**Wilt in Dhaincha:**
Dhaincha, like other legumes, can be susceptible to wilting caused by various soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Fusarium* species, *Rhizoctonia solani*, and *Sclerotium rolfsii*. These pathogens infect the roots and stem base, disrupting water and nutrient transport, leading to wilting, yellowing, and eventual plant death.

**Parawilt in Dhaincha:**
This is not known to affect Dhaincha. "Parawilt" is a term primarily associated with a specific sudden wilting condition in cotton, often linked to a complex of factors rather than a single pathogen. While Dhaincha can exhibit wilting symptoms, it is generally attributed to common root and stem rot pathogens rather than a distinct "Parawilt" condition.

**Control Measures for Wilt in Dhaincha:**

An integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is recommended for effective management of wilt diseases.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of Dhaincha or other susceptible legume crops in the same field. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) for at least 2-3 years to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   **Soil Health Management:** Improve soil drainage, as waterlogging can exacerbate root rot conditions. Incorporate organic matter (e.g., farmyard manure, compost) to enhance soil microbial activity and suppress pathogens.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sow Dhaincha at the recommended time to ensure vigorous growth and better resistance to diseases.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris from the field to prevent the build-up and spread of pathogens.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure adequate and balanced nutrient supply to the plants, as stressed plants are more susceptible to diseases.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-fungicide Application:** Apply beneficial microbial antagonists to the soil or as seed treatment.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply as a soil application at 2.5 kg per acre mixed with 50 kg of farmyard manure or compost, or as a seed treatment at 5-10 g per kg of seed. These fungi colonize the root zone and suppress pathogenic fungi.

**3. Chemical Control (as Seed Treatment):**
Seed treatment is highly effective in protecting young seedlings from early infection by soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Carbendazim**: Treat seeds at 1-2 g per kg of seed.
*   **Thiram**: Treat seeds at 2-3 g per kg of seed.
*   **Carboxin + Thiram (combination product)**: Treat seeds at 2-3 g per kg of seed.

Always ensure proper seed coverage and follow the manufacturer's instructions for safe handling and application. For any specific or severe outbreaks, it is advisable to consult with HAU experts for precise diagnosis and tailored recommendations.
