As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/rostrata) based on scientific principles and practices suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

Dhaincha, primarily grown as a green manure crop, is vital for improving soil health and nitrogen fixation. While generally hardy, it can suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, which can impact its growth and biomass production.

**General Recommendations:**

1.  **Soil Testing:** The most crucial step is to conduct a comprehensive soil test through a reputable lab (like HAU's soil testing labs). This will accurately identify which micronutrients are deficient and to what extent, allowing for targeted and efficient application.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Incorporate organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) regularly. These not only supply a range of micronutrients but also improve soil structure, water holding capacity, and the availability of existing nutrients. Dhaincha itself, when incorporated, contributes significantly to soil organic matter.
3.  **Foliar vs. Soil Application:** Foliar application is often preferred for micronutrients as it provides a quick response and requires smaller quantities, especially for standing crops. Soil application is suitable for correcting severe or persistent deficiencies identified through soil tests before sowing.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, bronzing, and small leaves (often called 'little leaf' symptom).
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing):**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (33% Zn): 20-25 kg/acre
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (21% Zn): 10-12 kg/acre
    *   **Foliar Application (during active growth):**
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (33% Zn): 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
        *   **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn): 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Severe interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which may turn almost white, while veins remain distinctly green. Common in high pH (calcareous) soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Generally less effective in high pH soils due to rapid fixation.
    *   **Foliar Application (during active growth):**
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe): 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
        *   **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe): 1 g/L of water (0.1% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals.
        *   *Note: Add a non-ionic wetting agent (spreader) for better absorption.*

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, death of growing points, distorted new leaves, cracking of stems, and sometimes poor flowering.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing, based on soil test):**
        *   **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5-11.3% B): 2-4 kg/acre
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1-2 kg/acre
        *   *Caution: Boron has a narrow range between deficiency and toxicity. Apply strictly based on soil test recommendations.*
    *   **Foliar Application (during active growth):**
        *   **Borax (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate)** (10.5-11.3% B): 2 g/L of water (0.2% solution). Apply 1-2 sprays.
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B): 1-2 g/L of water (0.1-0.2% solution). Apply 1-2 sprays.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Death of growing points, distorted and curled new leaves, stunted root growth. Less common as a primary deficiency in Haryana's soils unless highly acidic or very sandy.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing):**
        *   **Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate)** (23% Ca): 200-500 kg/acre (primarily for sodic soils, also supplies Ca).
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 10-20 kg/acre.
    *   **Foliar Application (during active growth):**
        *   **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca): 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution). Apply 1-2 sprays.
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (19% Ca): 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution). Apply 1-2 sprays.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves (veins remain green), sometimes with purplish discoloration in severe cases.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing):**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg): 10-20 kg/acre
    *   **Foliar Application (during active growth):**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg): 5-10 g/L of water (0.5-1.0% solution). Apply 1-2 sprays.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, often with small necrotic (dead) spots, and stunted growth. Can be confused with iron deficiency but usually appears on slightly older young leaves. Common in high pH soils.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing/at sowing):**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 5-10 kg/acre. Less effective in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (during active growth):**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn): 5 g/L of water (0.5% solution). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.

**Important Precautions:**

*   Always ensure uniform spray coverage for foliar applications.
*   Use clean water for mixing.
*   If tank-mixing with other pesticides or fertilizers, always check for compatibility.
*   Apply foliar sprays during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late afternoon) to avoid scorching and improve absorption.
*   Regular monitoring of crop health is essential to identify deficiencies early.

By following these scientifically verified recommendations, farmers can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in Dhaincha, ensuring healthy crop growth and maximizing its benefits as a green manure.
