As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) for green manure purposes in Haryana:

### Maturity Signs for Dhaincha (for Green Manure)

The maturity signs for Dhaincha, when grown for green manure, are crucial for maximizing its benefits to the soil. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Plant Height:** The plants typically reach a height of 1.5 to 2.0 meters.
*   **Stem Succulence:** The stems should still be relatively succulent and green, not overly woody or fibrous. This ensures easier decomposition and nutrient release.
*   **Flowering Stage:** The ideal stage is the pre-flowering stage or the very early stage of flowering (when approximately 5-10% of the flowers have just started to appear). Harvesting at this point ensures maximum accumulation of green biomass and nitrogen content in the plant tissue before significant lignification occurs.

### Harvesting Time for Dhaincha (for Green Manure)

The optimal harvesting time for Dhaincha as a green manure crop is critical for its effectiveness:

*   **Days After Sowing (DAS):** Dhaincha should generally be harvested and incorporated into the soil between **45 to 60 days after sowing (DAS)**.
*   **Biomass and Nitrogen Accumulation:** Harvesting within this window ensures the highest accumulation of green biomass and nitrogen in the plant, which are the primary benefits of green manuring.
*   **Avoid Delay:** Delaying harvesting beyond the early flowering stage can lead to the stems becoming woody and fibrous. Woody material decomposes much slower, potentially immobilizing nitrogen temporarily and delaying nutrient availability for the subsequent main crop.

### Cutting Process for Dhaincha (for Green Manure Incorporation)

The cutting and incorporation process is vital for effectively utilizing Dhaincha as green manure:

*   **Cutting Method:**
    *   **Manual Cutting:** For smaller areas, Dhaincha can be cut manually using sickles.
    *   **Mechanical Cutting:** For larger fields, tractor-mounted implements such as a disc plough, rotavator, or cultivator can be used to cut and incorporate the biomass.
*   **Immediate Incorporation:** It is crucial to incorporate the cut Dhaincha biomass into the soil immediately after cutting. This prevents significant loss of moisture and nutrients, especially nitrogen, through drying and volatilization.
*   **Depth of Incorporation:** The green manure should be thoroughly mixed and buried into the soil to a depth of **15-20 cm**. This ensures proper contact with soil microorganisms, which are responsible for decomposition.
*   **Equipment for Incorporation:**
    *   **Disc Plough/Mouldboard Plough:** These are effective for turning over the green manure and burying it deeply.
    *   **Rotavator:** A rotavator is highly efficient as it chops the green manure into smaller pieces and mixes it uniformly with the topsoil, significantly accelerating the decomposition process.
    *   **Cultivator:** Can be used for lighter incorporation, but may require multiple passes for effective mixing.
*   **Post-Incorporation Management:**
    *   **Irrigation:** After incorporation, a light irrigation can be beneficial to maintain adequate soil moisture, which is essential for microbial activity and rapid decomposition of the organic matter.
    *   **Decomposition Period:** Allow a minimum of **2-3 weeks** for the incorporated green manure to decompose sufficiently before sowing the subsequent main crop. This period helps prevent nitrogen immobilization, where soil microbes temporarily utilize available nitrogen for their own growth during the initial stages of decomposition, which could otherwise affect the early growth of the main crop.
