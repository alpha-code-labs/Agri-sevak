Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) is primarily grown as a green manure crop in Haryana, and effective weed control is crucial to maximize its biomass production for soil health benefits. The weed spectrum can vary, but the listed weeds are common concerns.

Here's a scientifically verified approach to control weeds in Dhaincha, keeping in mind its role as a green manure crop and the CIBRC guidelines for Haryana:

### Integrated Weed Management in Dhaincha

A combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is recommended for effective weed control.

#### 1. Cultural and Mechanical Practices

*   **Thorough Land Preparation:** Deep ploughing followed by harrowing helps in burying weed seeds and exposing rhizomes to the sun, reducing initial weed pressure.
*   **Timely Sowing:** Sowing Dhaincha at the optimal time (typically pre-monsoon or early monsoon in Haryana) allows it to establish quickly and outcompete emerging weeds.
*   **Optimum Seed Rate:** Using the recommended seed rate (e.g., 40-50 kg/acre for green manure) ensures a dense stand, which helps suppress weed growth through shading.
*   **Manual Weeding/Hoeing:** One or two manual weedings or hoeings within 20-30 days after sowing (DAS) are highly effective, especially for broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds. This is often the most practical method for green manure crops.

#### 2. Specific Weed Control Measures

*   **Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass):**
    *   **Cultural:** Early manual weeding is very effective.
    *   **Chemical (Pre-emergence):**
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.3 litres per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied within 0-3 days after sowing.
    *   **Chemical (Post-emergence):**
        *   **Imazethapyr** 10% SL at 100 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied at 15-20 DAS when weeds are at 2-4 leaf stage. This herbicide is effective against a wide range of broadleaf and some narrowleaf weeds and is safe for leguminous crops.
        *   **Bentazone** 48% SL at 800-1000 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied at 15-20 DAS. This is specific for broadleaf weeds.

*   **Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses):**
    *   **Cultural:** Manual weeding and proper land preparation.
    *   **Chemical (Pre-emergence):**
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.3 litres per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied within 0-3 days after sowing.
    *   **Chemical (Post-emergence):**
        *   **Quizalofop-ethyl** 5% EC at 400-500 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied at 15-20 DAS when grasses are at 2-4 leaf stage.
        *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9.3% EC at 250-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied at 15-20 DAS.
        *   **Clethodim** 24% EC at 200-250 ml per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied at 15-20 DAS.
        *   **Imazethapyr** 10% SL (as mentioned above) also provides some control of annual grasses.

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Cultural:**
        *   Use clean, Amarbail-free Dhaincha seeds.
        *   Remove any Amarbail patches manually before they flower and set seed. This is critical to prevent its spread.
        *   Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) can help reduce seed bank.
    *   **Chemical (Pre-emergence):**
        *   **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.3 litres per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water, applied within 0-3 days after sowing, can offer some suppression of Amarbail germination.
    *   **Chemical (Post-emergence):** Post-emergence chemical control of Amarbail in Dhaincha is very challenging as most effective herbicides for Amarbail can also harm the Dhaincha crop. Manual removal is the most reliable method.

*   **Orobanche:**
    *   This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly in Haryana. Orobanche species typically parasitize specific host plants, often from the Solanaceae, Brassicaceae, or Fabaceae families. While Dhaincha is a legume (Fabaceae), it is not commonly reported as a major host for Orobanche in the region, especially when grown as a short-duration green manure crop.

*   **Phalaris minor (Little Seed Canary Grass):**
    *   This is not known to affect Dhaincha. Phalaris minor is predominantly a weed of the Rabi (winter) season, primarily infesting wheat crops in Haryana. Dhaincha is typically grown in the Kharif (summer/monsoon) season, making Phalaris minor an unlikely weed concern.

#### 3. General Recommendations for Herbicide Application

*   Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific herbicide product for correct dosage, application timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure uniform spray coverage. Use a flat fan nozzle for herbicide application.
*   Apply herbicides when there is sufficient soil moisture. If the soil is dry, light irrigation before application can improve efficacy.
*   Avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift to non-target crops.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
