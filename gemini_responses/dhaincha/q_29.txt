This is not known to affect Dhaincha.

Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/rostrata) is primarily cultivated as a green manure crop in Haryana. It is typically incorporated into the soil before or at the early flowering stage to enrich soil fertility and nitrogen content. Therefore, the development of pods (fruits) or seeds is generally not the primary objective, and issues like flower or pod drop are not considered a concern for its intended use.

Furthermore, the terms "Tinda dropping" and "Boll dropping" are not applicable to Dhaincha, as Tinda refers to Indian round gourd and Boll refers to the fruit capsule of cotton.
