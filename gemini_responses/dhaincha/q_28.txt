As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for protecting Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) from environmental stresses in Haryana:

Dhaincha is a robust green manure crop, generally well-adapted to the warm conditions of Haryana. However, extreme environmental fluctuations can impact its growth and biomass production.

### Protection from Environmental Stress for Dhaincha:

**1. Extreme Cold and Frost:**
Dhaincha is a warm-season legume and is sensitive to cold temperatures and frost. It is typically grown during the Kharif season or as a summer green manure.

*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** The most effective strategy is to sow Dhaincha at the appropriate time (typically April to July in Haryana for green manure purposes). This ensures the crop completes its growth cycle before the onset of severe winter cold and frost, which usually occurs from November to February. Avoid late sowings that would expose young plants to early winter conditions.
*   **Irrigation:** If an unexpected cold snap or light frost is predicted, a light irrigation in the evening can help raise the soil temperature slightly and reduce the risk of frost damage. Water has a higher specific heat capacity than air, and moist soil radiates heat more slowly.
*   **Chemical Protection:** No specific CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations for frost protection in Dhaincha are generally practiced or economically viable for green manure crops. Cultural practices remain the primary defense.

**2. Heat/Loo (Hot Winds) and Intense Sunlight:**
Dhaincha is generally tolerant to high temperatures and intense sunlight. However, extreme heat combined with hot, dry winds (Loo), especially during periods of water scarcity, can cause stress, particularly during germination and early growth stages.

*   **Adequate and Timely Irrigation:** This is the most critical measure. Ensure the crop receives sufficient water, especially during prolonged dry spells and periods of high temperature coupled with hot winds. Adequate soil moisture helps maintain plant turgor, facilitates evaporative cooling, and allows the plant to cope with heat stress.
*   **Optimal Sowing Time:** Sowing Dhaincha at the recommended time (April-July) allows the crop to establish well, often benefiting from the monsoon rains, which mitigate the effects of extreme heat and Loo experienced in May-June.
*   **Nutrient Management:** A balanced nutrient supply, particularly adequate potassium, can enhance the plant's overall vigor and resilience to various environmental stresses, including heat.
*   **Chemical Protection:** No specific CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations are typically used for heat/Loo or intense sunlight protection in Dhaincha due to economic viability for a green manure crop. Good agronomic practices, especially irrigation, are paramount.
