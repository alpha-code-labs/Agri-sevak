As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/Sesbania cannabina) in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Dhaincha

Seed treatment is essential for ensuring good germination, early seedling vigor, and protection against seed-borne and early soil-borne pathogens. For Dhaincha, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Fungicidal Treatment:** To protect against common seed-borne and early soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off, seedling blight, and root rot.
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 12% + **Mancozeb** 63% WP at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   **OR**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS at 2.5 g/kg seed.
    *   *Method:* Mix the required quantity of fungicide thoroughly with the seeds using a seed treatment drum or by hand (wearing gloves). Ensure uniform coating.
2.  **Rhizobium Inoculation:** As Dhaincha is a leguminous crop, inoculation with an appropriate strain of *Rhizobium* is vital for effective nitrogen fixation, which is a primary benefit of growing Dhaincha as green manure.
    *   Inoculate seeds with **Rhizobium** culture at 200-250 g per 10-15 kg of seed.
    *   *Method:* Prepare a slurry by mixing the **Rhizobium** culture with a small amount of jaggery solution (25 g jaggery in 250 ml water) or rice gruel. Mix this slurry thoroughly with the fungicide-treated seeds, ensuring uniform coating. Allow seeds to dry in shade for 30 minutes before sowing.
    *   *Note:* Always perform fungicidal treatment first, followed by **Rhizobium** inoculation.

### Soil Treatment for Dhaincha

Dhaincha is primarily grown as a green manure crop, and its cultivation itself contributes significantly to soil health. Extensive chemical soil treatment is generally not required or recommended. However, to enhance soil health and manage soil-borne pathogens, the following biological approach is advised:

1.  **Bio-fungicide Application:** To suppress soil-borne fungal pathogens and promote beneficial microbial activity, especially if there is a history of soil-borne diseases in the field.
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** (2.5 kg/acre) or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** (2.5 kg/acre) mixed with 50-100 kg of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
    *   *Method:* Broadcast the mixture evenly over the field and incorporate it into the soil during the final land preparation, preferably 7-10 days before sowing.
2.  **Nematode Management:** Dhaincha is known to have suppressive effects on certain plant-parasitic nematodes and is often used as a bio-fumigant or trap crop. Therefore, specific chemical nematicide application is usually not necessary for Dhaincha cultivation.
    *   This is not known to affect Dhaincha in a way that requires routine chemical nematicide application, as Dhaincha itself can help in nematode management.
