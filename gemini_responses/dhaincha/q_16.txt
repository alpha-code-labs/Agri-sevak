As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer doses for Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) when grown as a green manure crop in Haryana.

Dhaincha is a leguminous crop known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Therefore, its external nitrogen requirement is minimal, primarily a starter dose to support early growth before nodulation is fully established. Phosphorus and Sulphur are crucial for nodulation and overall biomass production in legumes. Potassium is important for general plant health.

**General Nutrient Recommendations for Dhaincha (Green Manure):**
*   **Nitrogen (N):** 10-15 kg/acre (starter dose)
*   **Phosphorus (P2O5):** 20-25 kg/acre
*   **Potassium (K2O):** 10-15 kg/acre (if soil test indicates deficiency, otherwise optional for green manure)
*   **Sulphur (S):** 10-15 kg/acre

**Recommended Fertilizer Doses:**

You can achieve the recommended nutrient levels using different combinations of fertilizers. Soil testing is always recommended for precise nutrient management.

**Option 1: Using Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) as the primary P source**

*   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP):** 45-50 kg/acre (This provides approximately 8-9 kg N and 20-23 kg P2O5)
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 15-20 kg/acre (This provides approximately 9-12 kg K2O)
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):** 15 kg/acre (This provides approximately 13.5 kg S)

**Option 2: Using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) as the primary P and S source**

*   **Urea:** 20-25 kg/acre (This provides approximately 9-11.5 kg N)
*   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP):** 125-150 kg/acre (This provides approximately 20-24 kg P2O5 and 14-16.5 kg S)
*   **Muriate of Potash (MOP):** 15-20 kg/acre (This provides approximately 9-12 kg K2O)

**Option 3: Using NPK Complex Fertilizers**

If using a complex NPK fertilizer, choose a grade that provides the recommended N, P, and K. For example:

*   **NPK (12:32:16):** 60-70 kg/acre (This provides approximately 7-8.4 kg N, 19.2-22.4 kg P2O5, and 9.6-11.2 kg K2O)
*   **Elemental Sulphur (90% S):** 15 kg/acre (This provides approximately 13.5 kg S)

**Regarding Nano-Fertilizers:**

*   **Nano-Urea** and **Nano-DAP** are primarily designed for foliar application to supplement nutrient uptake during specific growth stages. For the initial basal application for a green manure crop like Dhaincha, conventional soil-applied fertilizers are generally recommended for cost-effectiveness and to establish the required nutrient base for robust biomass production. If used, they would typically be applied as foliar sprays at recommended concentrations (e.g., 2-4 ml/L for Nano-Urea, 2-4 ml/L for Nano-DAP) during the vegetative growth phase, but they are not a substitute for the primary basal dose of P and S for green manure.
