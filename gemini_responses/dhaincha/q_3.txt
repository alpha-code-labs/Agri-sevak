As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling rot types in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana.

It is important to note that Dhaincha, primarily grown as a green manure crop, is generally robust. However, it can be susceptible to certain rot diseases, especially under unfavorable conditions like waterlogging or high humidity.

Regarding your specific list of rot types:

*   **Black Rot:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **Fruit Rot:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha.

For the other rot types (Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, Neck, Seed, and Seedling rot), which are often caused by a complex of soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Pythium spp.*, *Fusarium spp.*, and *Sclerotium rolfsii*, an integrated approach is recommended:

### Integrated Management for Rot Diseases in Dhaincha

**1. Cultural Practices (Preventive Measures):**

*   **Site Selection and Drainage:** Choose well-drained fields. Avoid waterlogged conditions, as excessive moisture is a primary factor for rot development. If fields are prone to waterlogging, consider raised beds or improving drainage.
*   **Seedbed Preparation:** Prepare a fine and firm seedbed to ensure uniform germination and good root development.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce the build-up of soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Optimum Sowing:** Sow seeds at the recommended depth and spacing to ensure proper aeration and reduce competition. Avoid very dense sowing.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy any infected plant debris from previous crops to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced nutrient application. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, tender growth more susceptible to disease.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with bio-control agents to protect against soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP: 4-5 g/kg seed
    *   **Trichoderma harzianum** 1% WP: 4-5 g/kg seed
*   **Soil Application:** For fields with a history of severe rot problems, *Trichoderma* can also be applied to the soil.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** 1% WP or **Trichoderma harzianum** 1% WP: 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg of farmyard manure (FYM) or compost, and broadcast evenly before sowing or at the time of last ploughing.

**3. Chemical Control (As a last resort or for high-risk areas):**

Chemical control primarily focuses on seed treatment to protect against seed rot and seedling diseases (damping-off, seedling rot, early collar/foot rot).

*   **Seed Treatment:**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1-2 g/kg seed
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Captan** 50% WP: 2-3 g/kg seed
    *   **Metalaxyl-M 31.8% ES** (or **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** combination, e.g., 35% WS): 2-3 g/kg seed (particularly effective against *Pythium* and *Phytophthora* causing damping-off).

*   **Soil Drench (for established plants with collar/stem rot, if severe):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: 1 g/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP: 2-3 g/L water, drench around the base of affected plants.

Always ensure proper safety measures are followed when handling and applying chemical pesticides. Read and follow the instructions on the product label carefully.
