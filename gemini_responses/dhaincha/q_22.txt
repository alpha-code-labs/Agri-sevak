Here are the recommended cultivation practices for Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/Sesbania cannabina) in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Broadcasting:** This is the most common and efficient method for green manuring, allowing for quick coverage and dense stand establishment.
    *   **Line Sowing:** Can also be done, especially if intercropping or for seed production, using a seed drill.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Dhaincha seeds are relatively small, so a shallow planting depth is crucial for good germination and emergence.
    *   Recommended depth: 2-3 cm.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **For Broadcasting:** No specific spacing is maintained, as the aim is a dense, uniform stand.
    *   **For Line Sowing:**
        *   Row-to-row: 20-30 cm.
        *   Plant-to-plant: Not typically managed for green manuring as a dense stand is desired.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   To achieve an optimal dense stand for green manuring and biomass production:
        *   20-25 kg/acre.
