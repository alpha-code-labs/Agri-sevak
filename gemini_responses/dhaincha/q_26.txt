As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding specialized practices for Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/Sesbania rostrata) in Haryana:

*   **Pruning:**
    Pruning is not a standard or specialized practice for Dhaincha cultivation. Dhaincha is primarily grown as a green manure crop or for fodder. It is typically allowed to grow rapidly and is then incorporated into the soil or harvested before extensive flowering, making pruning unnecessary.

*   **Desuckering:**
    Desuckering is a practice typically applied to crops that produce basal suckers (e.g., banana, pineapple). Dhaincha does not exhibit this growth habit, and therefore, desuckering is not a relevant practice for Dhaincha.

*   **Mulching:**
    While mulching is a beneficial practice for soil moisture conservation, weed suppression, and temperature regulation in general agriculture, it is not considered a specialized practice *for* Dhaincha cultivation itself. Dhaincha is often grown as a green manure crop, and its biomass, when incorporated into the soil, contributes significantly to soil organic matter and acts as a form of green mulch. External mulching is not a common or specialized requirement for Dhaincha.

*   **Grafting:**
    Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join parts of two plants, typically for perennial crops or to combine desirable traits. Dhaincha is an annual crop primarily propagated by seeds, and grafting is not a practice employed in its cultivation.

*   **Pollination:**
    Dhaincha is primarily a self-pollinated crop, though insect-mediated cross-pollination can occur. It naturally produces flowers and sets seeds efficiently. Therefore, specialized pollination practices (such as hand pollination or managed pollinator introduction) are not required or commonly undertaken for Dhaincha cultivation, whether for green manure, fodder, or seed production. Natural pollination is sufficient.
