As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Dhaincha:

*   **Black Rust (*Puccinia graminis*)**: This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **Brown Rust (*Puccinia recondita* / *Puccinia triticina*)**: This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **Yellow Rust (*Puccinia striiformis*)**: This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **White Rust (*Albugo candida* and related species)**: This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*)**: This is not known to affect Dhaincha.

Dhaincha (Sesbania spp.) is generally quite robust and is not commonly affected by these specific rust diseases in Haryana. Therefore, no specific chemical control measures are recommended for these conditions in Dhaincha.
