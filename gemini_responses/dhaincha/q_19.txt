As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana.

Dhaincha is a leguminous crop primarily grown for green manuring, meaning it is incorporated into the soil to improve fertility. Its nutrient requirements are generally lower than main food crops, and its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen is a key advantage.

**General Recommendation:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a **soil test**. This will accurately determine the existing nutrient levels in your specific field and help tailor the fertilizer application, preventing over-application and ensuring efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address potential deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Dhaincha, being a legume, has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium) in its root nodules. Therefore, its external nitrogen requirement is significantly lower than non-leguminous crops.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of older leaves, stunted growth, pale green foliage.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Starter Dose:** A small starter dose of nitrogen is often beneficial, especially in soils with low organic matter or where initial nodulation might be slow. This helps the plant establish before nitrogen fixation becomes fully active.
    *   **Recommended Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of Nitrogen per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Chemical Source:**
        *   **Urea** (46% N): 20-40 kg per acre.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is crucial for root development, energy transfer, and the formation and functioning of root nodules in legumes, which are essential for nitrogen fixation.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, dark green or purplish discoloration of leaves (especially older ones), poor root development, delayed maturity.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Recommended Application:** Apply 20-30 kg of P2O5 per acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Chemical Sources:**
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): 125-188 kg per acre.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (46% P2O5, 18% N): 43-65 kg per acre. (If using DAP, reduce the Urea application accordingly to avoid excess nitrogen).

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a vital role in water regulation, nutrient transport, enzyme activation, and enhancing the plant's resistance to diseases and stress.

*   **Symptoms:** Yellowing and browning of leaf margins (scorching) on older leaves, weak stems, poor overall plant vigor.
*   **Addressing Deficiency:**
    *   **Recommended Application:** Apply 10-20 kg of K2O per acre at the time of sowing, especially if soil test indicates low levels.
    *   **Chemical Source:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MoP)** (60% K2O): 17-33 kg per acre.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Application Method:** For best results, broadcast the recommended phosphorus and potassium fertilizers and incorporate them into the soil before sowing. Nitrogen (Urea) can also be broadcast at sowing.
*   **Green Manure Benefit:** When Dhaincha is incorporated into the soil as green manure, the nutrients absorbed by the plant are returned to the soil, improving its fertility for subsequent crops.
*   **Organic Matter:** Maintaining good soil organic matter levels through practices like composting and crop residue management can significantly improve nutrient availability and soil health, reducing the reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
