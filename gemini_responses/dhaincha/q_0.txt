As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that the fungal diseases listed (Alternaria, Anthracnose, Blast, Blight, Brown spot, Downy/Powdery mildew, and Grey mildew) are generally **not known to significantly affect Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/Sesbania cannabina)** to an extent that requires chemical control measures, especially when grown as a green manure crop.

Dhaincha is a robust crop primarily cultivated for green manuring and is generally quite resistant to major disease outbreaks. Chemical interventions for these diseases are typically not recommended or economically viable for Dhaincha cultivation in Haryana.

Therefore, for the diseases mentioned:
*   **Alternaria:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly.
*   **Anthracnose:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly.
*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha.
*   **Blight:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly.
*   **Brown spot:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly.
*   **Downy/Powdery mildew:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly.
*   **Grey mildew:** This is not known to affect Dhaincha significantly.
