As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata/Sesbania rostrata) in Haryana.

Dhaincha is primarily grown as a green manure crop and is generally quite robust, rarely experiencing severe pest infestations that warrant extensive control measures. Natural enemies often keep pest populations in check.

**1. Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Dhaincha. Psylla species are typically highly host-specific, and Dhaincha is not a recognized host for any significant psylla pest.

**2. Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, and Thrips:**
While these are generalist sucking pests and can occasionally be observed on Dhaincha, severe infestations requiring intervention are uncommon, especially given that the crop is usually incorporated into the soil before pest populations can build up to damaging levels. However, if an unusual situation arises where control is deemed necessary, the following integrated pest management (IPM) strategies can be considered:

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Timely Sowing and Incorporation:** Ensure timely sowing and incorporation of Dhaincha into the soil as green manure. This often prevents pest populations from reaching damaging levels or completing their life cycles.
*   **Maintain Crop Vigor:** Healthy plants are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper soil health and moisture.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Dhaincha fields naturally host a variety of beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverflies, and parasitic wasps, which are highly effective in controlling aphids, whiteflies, and leafhoppers. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficials.

**C. Chemical Control (As a last resort, and generally not recommended for green manure crops):**
If pest populations are exceptionally high and threatening the stand (which is rare for Dhaincha), and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, a targeted insecticide application might be considered. Always ensure thorough coverage.

*   For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: 125-150 ml per acre
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: 50-100 g per acre
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: 50-100 g per acre

*   Specifically for Thrips and Leafhoppers:
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400-600 ml per acre

*   Specifically for Whitefly nymphs:
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: 500-600 ml per acre

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the label instructions of any pesticide product for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current recommendations specific to your field conditions.
