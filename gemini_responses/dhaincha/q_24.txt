Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata or Sesbania rostrata) is primarily cultivated as a green manure crop in Haryana. For this purpose, **transplantation is generally not recommended or practiced.**

Dhaincha establishes very easily from direct seeding, grows rapidly, and is typically sown over large areas. Transplanting would be economically unfeasible and labor-intensive for a crop whose primary purpose is to incorporate biomass into the soil.

Therefore, there is no "ideal transplantation time, distance, or process" for Dhaincha. The recommended and standard practice is direct sowing.

Below are the ideal practices for **Direct Sowing** of Dhaincha:

*   **Ideal Sowing Time:**
    *   For green manure, Dhaincha is typically sown from **mid-April to mid-July** in Haryana. This timing allows it to be grown before the main Kharif crop (e.g., rice, maize) or as an inter-season crop.
    *   The exact timing depends on the subsequent crop and the desired biomass accumulation period (usually 45-60 days).

*   **Ideal Sowing Distance (Spacing):**
    *   When sown for green manure, Dhaincha is usually broadcast or sown in closely spaced rows to achieve a dense stand.
    *   **Row to row distance:** 20-30 cm
    *   **Plant to plant distance:** Not typically maintained precisely due to broadcasting or dense sowing. The goal is a uniform, dense stand.

*   **Ideal Sowing Process:**
    *   **Land Preparation:** Prepare a fine seedbed by 1-2 ploughings followed by planking to ensure good soil tilth.
    *   **Seed Rate:**
        *   For green manure: **40-60 kg/acre**. Higher rates are used for broadcasting, while lower rates are sufficient for line sowing.
    *   **Sowing Method:**
        *   **Broadcasting:** Seeds are evenly scattered over the prepared field and then lightly incorporated into the soil using a harrow or planker.
        *   **Line Sowing:** Seeds are sown in rows using a seed drill at a depth of 2-3 cm. Line sowing generally results in better germination and a more uniform stand.
    *   **Irrigation:** A light irrigation immediately after sowing is beneficial for good germination, especially if the soil moisture is insufficient. Subsequent irrigations may be needed depending on rainfall and soil type.
    *   **Incorporation:** The Dhaincha crop is typically incorporated into the soil when it is 45-60 days old, or when it reaches the flowering stage but before seed setting. This is done using a disc plough or rotavator to maximize nutrient benefits.
