As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana.

Both termites and root-knot nematodes are known to affect a wide range of crops, including Dhaincha, especially in conditions conducive to their proliferation. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, is recommended for sustainable control.

### General Management Principles:

*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through regular incorporation of organic matter (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to enhance beneficial microbial activity, which can naturally suppress pests.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.

### 1. Control of Termites (Odontotermes obesus, Microtermes obesi, etc.)

Termites are polyphagous pests that can damage Dhaincha roots and stems, leading to wilting and plant death, especially in dry conditions.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Deep ploughing during summer exposes termites to predators and desiccation.
*   Remove dead wood, stubble, and other organic debris from the field that can serve as food sources or nesting sites for termites.
*   Ensure proper irrigation to keep the soil moist, as termites prefer dry conditions.

**Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
For severe infestations, chemical control can be employed as a prophylactic measure or at the time of sowing.

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply 2.5 Litres per acre mixed with 200-400 litres of water as a soil drench before sowing or at the time of land preparation. Ensure uniform coverage and incorporation into the soil.
*   **Fipronil 0.3% GR**: Apply 8-10 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before sowing.

### 2. Control of Nematodes (Root-knot Nematodes - Meloidogyne spp.)

Root-knot nematodes are microscopic roundworms that infect plant roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs water and nutrient uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and reduced biomass of Dhaincha.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Dhaincha with non-host crops (e.g., some cereals like wheat, barley) to break the nematode life cycle.
*   **Summer Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during hot summer months exposes nematode eggs and larvae to direct sunlight, reducing their population.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tonnes per acre. Neem cake (200-400 kg per acre) can also be highly effective due to its nematicidal properties.
*   **Solarization:** Covering the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets during peak summer for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce nematode populations in the topsoil.

**Biological Control:**
*   **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or *Purpureocillium lilacinum*): Apply 2.5 kg per acre of a bio-nematicide formulation containing *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (1x10^8 CFU/g) mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost. Broadcast and incorporate into the soil before sowing or at sowing.

**Chemical Control (Soil Application):**
For fields with a history of severe nematode infestation, chemical nematicides can be used.

*   **Carbosulfan 6% GR**: Apply 10-13 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before sowing or at sowing.
*   **Fluensulfone 2% GR**: Apply 8-10 kg per acre by broadcasting and incorporating into the soil before sowing or at sowing.

**Important Note:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the product label for dosage, application method, and safety precautions. Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
