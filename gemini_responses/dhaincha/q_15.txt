As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata) in Haryana:

### Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation, especially in young Dhaincha plants.

**Cultural Control:**
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing helps expose grasshopper eggs to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing future populations.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove weeds from field bunds and surrounding areas, as they can serve as alternate hosts and breeding sites for grasshoppers.
*   **Mechanical Collection:** In small areas, hand-picking and destroying grasshopper nymphs and adults can be effective.

**Chemical Control:**
For severe infestations, especially in young crops or those grown for seed, chemical intervention may be necessary. Apply insecticides during the early morning or late evening for best results.

*   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.25 litres per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 200-250 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 500 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water.

### Painted bug

This is not known to affect Dhaincha.

### Red cotton bug

### Black ants

This is not known to affect Dhaincha as a primary pest causing direct damage to the crop.
