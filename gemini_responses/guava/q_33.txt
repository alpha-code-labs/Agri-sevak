As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach for Guava orchards, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**General Weed Management Principles in Guava Orchards:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, crop residues) around the base of trees to suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
    *   **Inter-cultivation:** Shallow cultivation between rows can control young weeds, but avoid deep tillage near tree roots.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Maintain recommended tree spacing to allow canopy closure, which can shade out weeds.

2.  **Mechanical Methods:**
    *   **Hand Weeding/Hoeing:** Effective for controlling weeds close to the tree trunk, especially in young orchards where chemical use should be minimized.
    *   **Mowing:** Regular mowing in inter-row spaces can manage grass and broadleaf weeds, preventing seed set.

3.  **Chemical Methods (Herbicides):**
    *   Herbicides should be used judiciously, especially around young trees. Always use spray shields to prevent drift onto Guava foliage.

**Specific Weed Control Recommendations for Guava:**

**1. Broadleaf and Narrowleaf Weeds (General):**

*   **Pre-emergent Herbicides (Applied before weed emergence, to moist soil):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply 1.0-1.3 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply 400-800 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
    *   **Diuron** (80% WP): Apply 1.0-1.5 kg per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Use with caution, especially in young orchards.

*   **Post-emergent Herbicides (Applied after weed emergence, when weeds are actively growing):**
    *   **Non-selective (use with extreme caution, avoid contact with Guava foliage):**
        *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply 1.0-1.5 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water. Use a spray shield to prevent drift.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply 600-800 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water. This is a contact herbicide; use a spray shield.
    *   **Selective for Grasses (Narrowleaf weeds, use with caution):**
        *   **Quizalofop ethyl** (5% EC): Apply 400-500 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** (13.4% EC): Apply 500-750 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**

*   **Mechanical:** For small infestations, hand-pulling and removal of affected Guava branches is the most effective method. Destroy the removed plant material to prevent re-infestation.
*   **Chemical (Spot application with extreme caution):**
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Spot application at 5-7 ml per litre of water, targeting only the Amarbail. Ensure no contact with healthy Guava foliage.
    *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Spot application at 10-15 ml per litre of water, with similar caution.

**3. Bathu (Chenopodium album):**

*   This is a common broadleaf weed. Control measures for general broadleaf weeds apply.
*   **Mechanical:** Hand weeding or shallow hoeing when young.
*   **Chemical:** Use pre-emergent herbicides like **Pendimethalin** or **Oxyfluorfen**. For post-emergent control, carefully apply **Glyphosate** or **Paraquat dichloride** with a spray shield.

**4. Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**

*   **Mechanical:** Hand-pulling of young plants before flowering is effective. Wear gloves as it can cause skin allergies.
*   **Biological:** Release of *Zygogramma bicolorata* beetles, if available and approved for your region.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   **Glyphosate** (41% SL): Apply 1.0-1.5 litres per acre in 200-300 litres of water when Parthenium is young and actively growing. Use a spray shield to prevent drift onto Guava foliage.
    *   **Paraquat dichloride** (24% SL): Apply 600-800 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water as a contact herbicide, with a spray shield.

**5. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

*   This is not known to affect Guava. Orobanche species are root parasites primarily on specific dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tobacco, and some vegetables, not Guava.

**6. Phalaris minor (Little seed canary grass):**

*   This is not known to be a significant weed problem in Guava orchards. *Phalaris minor* is predominantly a weed of winter cereal crops, especially wheat. If present, general grass control measures (e.g., **Quizalofop ethyl**, **Fluazifop-P-butyl**, or non-selective **Glyphosate** with extreme care) would be effective.

**Important Precautions for Herbicide Application:**

*   **Drift Management:** Always use spray shields, low-pressure nozzles, and avoid spraying on windy days to prevent herbicide drift onto Guava foliage, which can cause severe damage.
*   **Young Trees:** Exercise extreme caution around young Guava trees. Mulching and hand weeding are often safer alternatives.
*   **Water Volume:** Ensure adequate water volume for uniform coverage of the weeds.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves, mask, and protective clothing.
*   **Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the manufacturer's label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions for any chemical product.
