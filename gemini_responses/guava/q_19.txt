As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Guava (Psidium guajava) orchards in Haryana. While a comprehensive soil test is always the most accurate way to determine specific nutrient requirements, here are general guidelines for correcting Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium deficiencies.

### Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, stunted growth, reduced leaf size, poor flowering, and diminished fruit set.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply **Urea** at 100-200 g per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications (e.g., post-harvest, pre-flowering).
        *   For mature bearing trees (4+ years): Apply **Urea** at 300-600 g per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
        *   Alternatively, **Ammonium Sulfate** can be used, providing both N and S. Adjust rates based on N content.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick, temporary relief):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Urea** (10-20 g/L water) at fortnightly intervals until symptoms subside. Avoid spraying during hot periods of the day.

### Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:** Dark green to purplish discoloration of older leaves (especially on the underside), stunted growth, poor root development, delayed maturity, and reduced fruit size.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so basal application is most effective.
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP) at 100-200 g per tree per year, or **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP) at 300-600 g per tree per year. Apply once annually, preferably before the main flowering flush.
        *   For mature bearing trees (4+ years): Apply **Diammonium Phosphate** (DAP) at 200-400 g per tree per year, or **Single Super Phosphate** (SSP) at 600-1200 g per tree per year. Apply once annually.
    *   Incorporate the fertilizer into the soil around the drip line of the tree.

### Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is essential for fruit quality (size, taste, shelf life), water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:** Scorching or browning of leaf margins (especially older leaves), weak stems, poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, poor fruit quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For young trees (1-3 years): Apply **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) at 100-200 g per tree per year, split into 1-2 applications.
        *   For mature bearing trees (4+ years): Apply **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) at 200-500 g per tree per year, split into 1-2 applications.
        *   Alternatively, **Sulfate of Potash** (SOP) can be used, especially in saline soils or where sulfur is also deficient. Adjust rates based on K content.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick, temporary relief):**
        *   Spray a 1-2% solution of **Potassium Nitrate** (10-20 g/L water) or **Sulfate of Potash** (10-20 g/L water) at fortnightly intervals.

### Important Considerations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test through a reputable laboratory (like HAU's soil testing lab) to determine the exact nutrient status of your orchard soil. This will allow for precise and efficient fertilizer recommendations, preventing over-application and nutrient imbalances.
*   **Application Method:** Apply granular fertilizers uniformly around the tree's drip line (the area under the canopy where water drips) and lightly incorporate them into the soil, followed by irrigation.
*   **Timing:** Generally, Nitrogen is applied in split doses throughout the active growing season, while Phosphorus and Potassium are best applied as basal doses before the main growth flush or flowering period.
*   **Organic Matter:** Regular incorporation of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, enhancing the efficiency of chemical fertilizers.
