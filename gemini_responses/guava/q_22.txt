As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Guava (Psidium guajava L.) in Haryana:

Guava is primarily propagated vegetatively (through budding, grafting, or air layering) for commercial orchards to ensure true-to-type plants and early fruiting. Seeds are generally used for raising rootstock in the nursery.

### I. Nursery Practices (for raising rootstock from seed)

If you intend to raise rootstock from seeds, the following practices are recommended:

*   **Sowing method/pattern:**
    *   Seeds should be sown in well-prepared raised nursery beds (approximately 1 meter wide and of convenient length).
    *   Line sowing is preferred over broadcasting as it facilitates better management practices like weeding, thinning, and lifting of seedlings. Lines can be spaced 10-15 cm apart.
*   **Planting depth:**
    *   Sow seeds at a shallow depth of 1-2 cm. Deeper sowing can hinder germination.
*   **Seed dose:**
    *   Approximately 500 grams to 1 kilogram of seeds are required to raise seedlings for rootstock in an area of 100 square meters of nursery bed. This quantity typically yields enough seedlings for planting 1-2 acres of orchard, depending on the spacing.

### II. Main Field Planting Practices (for vegetatively propagated saplings)

For establishing a commercial guava orchard using vegetatively propagated saplings (budded, grafted, or air-layered plants):

*   **Planting method/pattern:**
    *   Planting is typically done in a square system, though rectangular or high-density planting systems are also gaining popularity.
    *   Pits of 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter (length x width x depth) should be dug at the recommended spacing during summer (May-June).
    *   These pits should be refilled with a mixture of topsoil, 20-25 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), 1 kg of neem cake, and 500 grams of single super phosphate (SSP) before the monsoon season.
    *   Saplings are then planted in the center of these prepared pits, preferably during the monsoon (July-August) or spring (February-March).
*   **Planting depth:**
    *   Plant the saplings at the same depth as they were in the nursery bag or pot. Ensure the graft union (if applicable) remains above the soil surface.
*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Standard Spacing:** 6 meters x 6 meters (plant to plant and row to row). This accommodates approximately 277 plants per acre.
    *   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** This system is increasingly popular for higher yields and better management.
        *   3 meters x 3 meters (approximately 1111 plants per acre).
        *   4 meters x 2 meters (approximately 833 plants per acre).
        *   4 meters x 4 meters (approximately 694 plants per acre).
    *   The choice of spacing depends on the cultivar, soil fertility, irrigation facilities, and the farmer's management practices. High-density planting requires more intensive management, including regular pruning.
