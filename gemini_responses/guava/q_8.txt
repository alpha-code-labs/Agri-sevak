Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding sucking pests in Guava. Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla are indeed significant pests of Guava (Psidium guajava) in our region, capable of causing considerable damage by directly feeding on plant sap and transmitting viral diseases.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for their control:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy for Sucking Pests in Guava**

A holistic approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective for sustainable management.

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Guava trees, especially the tender shoots, undersides of leaves, and flower buds, for the presence of these pests. Early detection is key to effective management.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy infested twigs, leaves, and water sprouts, as these often harbor pest populations.
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds, as many weeds act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, tender growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
    *   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to reduce plant stress, making them less susceptible.
3.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like ladybird beetles, lacewings, and syrphid fly larvae, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   Parasitoids like *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies can be effective.
4.  **Chemical Control:**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Apply sprays preferably in the morning or evening hours.

**CIBRC Approved Chemical Recommendations for Sucking Pests in Guava:**

Please use the following technical chemical names and dosages. Always read the label instructions carefully before use and observe the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI).

*   **For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.5 g per litre of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
    *   **Dimethoate 30% EC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Note: This is an older chemistry, use judiciously and rotate).
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water.

*   **Specifically for Whiteflies and Hoppers (especially nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. (Insect Growth Regulator, effective on nymphs).
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 0.6 - 1.0 g per litre of water. (Effective against whiteflies and thrips).
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water. (Systemic, effective against a broad range of sucking pests including whiteflies, aphids, and mealybugs).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation:** Never use the same chemical repeatedly. Rotate between different groups of insecticides (e.g., Neonicotinoids, Organophosphates, IGRs, Thioureas) to prevent pest resistance.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves where many of these pests reside.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing while handling and spraying chemicals. Keep chemicals out of reach of children and livestock.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the PHI mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
