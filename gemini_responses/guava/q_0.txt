As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Guava in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Guava requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical interventions.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, infected fruits, and pruned branches from the orchard. This reduces the inoculum source for future infections.
*   **Pruning:** Prune trees to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth. Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches.
*   **Nutrition:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization. Healthy trees are more resilient to diseases.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting, as wet foliage promotes fungal development. Drip irrigation is preferred.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Guava:**

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria psidii*):**
    This disease causes small, dark, irregular spots on leaves, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to defoliation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
        *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water can also be effective.

2.  **Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*) & Blight:**
    Anthracnose is a major disease affecting leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruits, causing sunken, dark lesions. "Blight" is a general term often referring to rapid browning and death of plant tissues, frequently caused by *Colletotrichum* or other fungi, and its management often overlaps with Anthracnose.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water is also effective, especially as a protective spray.
        *   For systemic action, **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water or **Difenoconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water can be used.

3.  **Brown Spot (Caused by *Cercospora psidii* or similar fungi):**
    Characterized by small, circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, which may have a purplish margin.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
        *   **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water can also be used.
        *   **Copper oxychloride 50% WP** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water provides good protection.

4.  **Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium psidii*):**
    Appears as white, powdery patches on young leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits, leading to distortion and reduced growth.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Apply **Sulphur 80% WP** (Wettable Sulphur) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water. Ensure good coverage.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Hexaconazole 5% EC** at 1.0-1.5 ml/L of water.
        *   **Myclobutanil 10% WP** at 0.4-0.5 g/L of water is also effective.
        *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water can provide control as it has broad-spectrum activity.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Guava:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Guava.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Guava.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Guava.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Timing of Application:** For best results, apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease symptoms. Repeat applications as per label recommendations, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, rainfall).
*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts (leaves, stems, fruits) during spraying.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI). Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
