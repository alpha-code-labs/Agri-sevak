As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Guava (Psidium guajava L.) in Haryana. Proper cultural practices form the foundation of healthy plant growth, and specific interventions can address these issues.

Here's how to manage the mentioned growth issues:

### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth is often indicative of underlying stress or nutritional deficiencies.

*   **Causes:** Nutrient deficiency (especially Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), water stress, poor soil health (compaction, low organic matter, incorrect pH), root damage, or pest/disease pressure.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to identify nutrient imbalances and pH issues.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply a balanced NPK fertilizer based on soil test recommendations. Ensure adequate micronutrient availability.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg/tree annually) to improve soil structure and nutrient retention.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry periods, to prevent water stress.
    *   **Pruning:** Light pruning can stimulate new vegetative growth.
    *   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
        *   Foliar spray of **Gibberellic acid (GA3)** at 25-50 mg/L (0.0025-0.005%) can promote vegetative growth, especially when other limiting factors have been addressed.

### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is typically a symptom of nutrient deficiency, particularly micronutrients, or issues affecting nutrient uptake.

*   **Causes:** Deficiency of Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Manganese (Mn), or Nitrogen (N); high soil pH (which makes micronutrients unavailable); waterlogging; or root damage.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Identify specific nutrient deficiencies and soil pH.
    *   **pH Correction:** If high soil pH is the cause, apply acidifying fertilizers or soil amendments like gypsum (if sodicity is an issue) or elemental sulphur.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can impair root function and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Nutrient Application:**
        *   For Iron deficiency: Foliar spray of **Ferrous sulphate** at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1.0%) solution.
        *   For Zinc deficiency: Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** at 5 g/L (0.5%) solution.
        *   For Manganese deficiency: Foliar spray of **Manganese sulphate** at 5 g/L (0.5%) solution.
        *   For Nitrogen deficiency: Foliar spray of **Urea** at 5-10 g/L (0.5-1.0%) solution, often combined with micronutrient sprays for better absorption.
        *   Apply these sprays during cooler parts of the day. Repeat if necessary after 15-20 days.

### 3. Excessive Height

Uncontrolled vertical growth can make harvesting difficult and reduce light penetration into the canopy, affecting fruit quality.

*   **Causes:** Lack of regular pruning, high nitrogen fertilization, or specific cultivar characteristics.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Pruning and Training:** Implement regular training and pruning practices from a young age to maintain a manageable tree height and open canopy structure. Heading back cuts on main branches can control height.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers, which promote vegetative growth. Focus on a balanced NPK ratio.
    *   **Plant Growth Retardants (PGRs):**
        *   **Paclobutrazol**: This is an effective growth retardant. Apply as a soil drench at 2-5 g active ingredient per mature tree, typically during the post-harvest period or before the main flowering flush. The exact dosage depends on tree age, size, and desired effect. Consult with HAU experts for precise recommendations for your specific orchard conditions.
        *   **Chlormequat chloride**: Foliar spray at 500-1000 mg/L (0.05-0.1%) can also be used to reduce vegetative growth and control height.

### 4. Excessive Flowering

While flowering is desirable, excessive flowering can lead to a high fruit load that the tree cannot sustain, resulting in small, poor-quality fruits or premature fruit drop.

*   **Causes:** Stress conditions (e.g., drought, nutrient deficiency), specific cultivar characteristics, or sometimes a rebound effect from previous heavy pruning or growth retardant application.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Manual Thinning:** Manually remove excess flowers or young fruits to achieve an optimal fruit load, ensuring better fruit size and quality.
    *   **Chemical Thinning:**
        *   **Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)**: Foliar spray at 10-20 mg/L (0.001-0.002%) at the full bloom stage or early fruit set stage to thin excess flowers/fruits.
        *   **Ethephon**: Foliar spray at 100-200 mg/L (0.01-0.02%) at the full bloom stage or early fruit set stage can also be used for thinning.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure the tree receives balanced nutrition to support fruit development rather than just excessive flowering.

Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and follow label instructions for all chemical applications. For specific dosages and timings tailored to your orchard, it is advisable to consult with agricultural experts from HAU.
