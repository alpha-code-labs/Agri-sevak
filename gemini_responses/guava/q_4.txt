Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

Wilt and Parawilt are significant challenges for guava cultivation in Haryana, leading to substantial yield losses. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an integrated approach for effective management.

**Understanding the Conditions:**

*   **Guava Wilt:** This is primarily caused by the soil-borne fungus *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *psidii*. It leads to yellowing, wilting, and eventual death of the plant.
*   **Guava Parawilt:** This is a physiological disorder, not caused by a pathogen. It is often triggered by sudden changes in soil moisture (waterlogging followed by drought, or vice-versa), root damage, or nutrient imbalances, leading to sudden wilting and drying of branches or the entire plant.

Here's how to control these conditions:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Most Important for Prevention and Management):**

*   **Site Selection:** Plant guava in well-drained soils. Avoid heavy clay soils or areas prone to waterlogging.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks/Varieties:** Where available and suitable for Haryana conditions, use resistant rootstocks or varieties. HAU recommends specific varieties for their adaptability and disease tolerance.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, cover the soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to raise soil temperature and reduce pathogen load.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain consistent soil moisture. Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress. Use drip irrigation for efficient water management.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure good drainage in the orchard, especially during monsoon. Create raised beds if necessary.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can make plants more susceptible. Apply farmyard manure (FYM) or compost regularly to improve soil health.
*   **Root Protection:** Avoid any injury to the roots during intercultural operations like weeding or tilling, as wounds can serve as entry points for pathogens.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy severely infected or dead plants immediately to prevent the spread of the disease. Disinfect tools after working on infected plants.
*   **Intercropping:** Avoid intercropping with susceptible crops.
*   **Liming:** In acidic soils, apply lime to adjust soil pH, which can be unfavorable for the wilt pathogen.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicides:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply 2.5 kg of *Trichoderma* formulation mixed with 50 kg of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) per acre, broadcasted and incorporated into the soil, or apply as a soil drench at 5-10 g/L of water around the root zone of affected plants. Repeat application every 3-4 months.

**III. Chemical Control (For Wilt, as a last resort or in conjunction with other methods):**

*   **Soil Drenching:** For early stages of wilt, drenching the soil around the root zone with systemic fungicides can be effective.
    *   **Carbendazim**: Drench the soil with a solution of **Carbendazim** at 1-2 g/L of water (e.g., 10-20 g per 10 litres of water) around the base of the affected plants. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per plant, depending on its size. Repeat after 30-45 days if necessary.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl**: As an alternative or in rotation with Carbendazim, drench the soil with **Thiophanate-methyl** at 1-2 g/L of water around the base of the affected plants. Apply 5-10 litres of solution per plant.

**Important Considerations:**

*   For Parawilt, since it's a physiological disorder, chemical fungicides are not effective. Focus entirely on improving soil health, proper irrigation, and preventing root damage.
*   Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and safety precautions when using any chemical.
*   Consult with HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.

By adopting these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of Wilt and Parawilt in your guava orchard.
