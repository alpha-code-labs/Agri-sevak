As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice regarding the suitable climate, soil type, and drainage requirements for Guava (Psidium guajava) cultivation in Haryana:

### Suitable Climate for Guava

Guava is a hardy, tropical to sub-tropical fruit crop that can thrive in a wide range of climatic conditions, making it well-suited for Haryana's environment.

*   **Temperature:** It prefers warm, frost-free conditions.
    *   Optimal temperature range for growth and fruiting is generally between 20°C and 30°C.
    *   Mature trees can tolerate temperatures up to 45°C during summer and down to 0°C for short periods in winter. However, young plants are susceptible to frost damage, especially in severe winter conditions common in parts of Haryana.
*   **Rainfall:** Guava can be grown in areas with annual rainfall ranging from 1000 mm to 2000 mm. It can also be successfully cultivated under rainfed conditions in areas with moderate rainfall, but supplemental irrigation during dry periods, especially during fruit development, significantly improves yield and quality.
*   **Sunlight:** Requires ample sunlight for good growth and fruit production.

### Suitable Soil Type for Guava

Guava is highly adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but certain characteristics are ideal for optimal production.

*   **Texture:** Prefers well-drained, fertile soils.
    *   Ideal soils are deep, loamy to sandy loam.
    *   It can also tolerate heavier clay soils, provided they have good internal drainage.
*   **pH:** Guava thrives in a wide pH range.
    *   Optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5.
    *   It can tolerate slightly acidic to moderately alkaline soils (up to pH 8.5), but extreme pH values can affect nutrient availability.
*   **Salinity:** While somewhat tolerant, high soil salinity can negatively impact growth and yield.

### Drainage Requirement for Guava

Good drainage is a critical factor for successful guava cultivation.

*   **Waterlogging:** Guava plants are highly sensitive to waterlogging.
    *   Poor drainage leads to water stagnation around the root zone, which can cause root rot, nutrient deficiency, and ultimately plant death.
*   **Internal Drainage:** The soil must have good internal drainage to allow excess water to percolate away quickly.
*   **Site Selection:** Avoid low-lying areas or fields with hardpans that impede water movement. If such areas must be used, consider raised beds or improved drainage systems.
