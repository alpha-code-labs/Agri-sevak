As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide you with scientifically verified information on specialized practices for Guava cultivation relevant to Haryana.

Here is information on the requested specialized practices:

*   **Pruning**
    *   **Objective:** Pruning in guava is crucial for shaping the tree, removing dead/diseased wood, encouraging new growth, improving light penetration, air circulation, and regulating fruiting. Guava fruits on current season's growth in the axils of leaves, making light annual pruning beneficial.
    *   **Training (Initial Pruning):** Young guava plants are trained to a single stem up to about 60-90 cm from the ground, allowing 3-4 well-spaced scaffold branches to develop. This creates an open-vase or modified central leader system.
    *   **Maintenance Pruning:**
        *   **Timing:** The best time for pruning is immediately after the main harvest, typically in February-March for the winter crop, or May-June if the aim is to regulate the crop for the winter season.
        *   **Method:** Remove all dead, diseased, broken, or crossing branches. Thin out crowded branches to allow better light penetration and air circulation within the canopy. Heading back (cutting back terminal shoots) by about 15-30 cm encourages new flushes of growth, which will bear fruit. Water sprouts and suckers should also be removed.
        *   **Crop Regulation:** Pruning is an integral part of crop regulation in guava, often combined with other practices like de-blossoming and nutrient management, to ensure a high-quality winter crop and avoid the low-quality rainy season crop.

*   **Desuckering**
    *   **Objective:** Desuckering involves removing unwanted shoots (suckers) that emerge from the rootstock below the graft union or from the base of the main trunk. These suckers compete with the main plant for nutrients and water, reducing its vigor and productivity.
    *   **Timing:** Suckers should be removed as soon as they appear. Regular monitoring is essential.
    *   **Method:** Physically remove the suckers by cutting them close to their point of origin using a sharp, clean pruning shear. Ensure they are not allowed to grow large, as their removal can then cause more damage to the main plant.

*   **Mulching**
    *   **Objective:** Mulching is a highly beneficial practice for guava orchards, especially in Haryana's climate. It helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, regulate soil temperature, improve soil structure, and reduce soil erosion.
    *   **Materials:** Organic mulches such as wheat straw, paddy straw, dry leaves, grass clippings, sugarcane trash, or farmyard manure are highly recommended. Black plastic mulch can also be used.
    *   **Application:** Apply a uniform layer of mulch around the base of the tree, extending to the drip line. Ensure the mulch is kept slightly away (5-10 cm) from the main trunk to prevent collar rot and pest issues.
    *   **Depth:** A layer of 10-15 cm thickness is generally effective for organic mulches.
    *   **Timing:** Mulch should ideally be applied before the onset of summer to conserve moisture and regulate soil temperature, or before the monsoon to suppress weeds. Replenish as needed.

*   **Grafting**
    *   **Objective:** Grafting is the primary method for commercial propagation of guava, ensuring true-to-type plants with desired characteristics (e.g., fruit quality, yield, disease resistance if a specific rootstock is used). It also allows for faster fruiting compared to seedling plants.
    *   **Common Methods:**
        *   **Stooling (Ground Layering):** This is a very common and successful method for guava propagation in India. Mother plants are cut back to ground level, and new shoots emerging from the stump are ringed, treated with rooting hormones, and mounded with soil to encourage root formation.
        *   **Air Layering (Gootee):** Also widely practiced, where a branch is ringed, treated with rooting hormone, covered with moist sphagnum moss and polythene, and allowed to root before being detached.
        *   **Veneer Grafting:** This method involves joining a scion (desired variety) onto a rootstock (seedling). It has a good success rate and is often performed during the active growth periods.
        *   **Inarching (Approach Grafting):** This method involves joining a scion still attached to its mother plant to a potted rootstock. It has a very high success rate but is more laborious.
    *   **Timing:** Grafting and layering are generally most successful during periods of active growth, typically during the monsoon season (July-September) or in spring (February-March).
    *   **Rootstock:** Seedlings of vigorous local guava varieties are commonly used as rootstocks.

*   **Pollination**
    *   **Nature of Pollination:** Guava (Psidium guajava) is largely a self-pollinating crop. Most commercial varieties are self-fertile, meaning they can produce fruit with their own pollen.
    *   **Pollinators:** While self-pollination is dominant, insects, particularly bees (e.g., honeybees, stingless bees), play a significant role in cross-pollination and can enhance fruit set and quality. Wind can also contribute to pollen dispersal.
    *   **Specific Practices:** No specialized pollination practices like hand-pollination or introduction of specific pollinator varieties are typically required for commercial guava cultivation. Maintaining a healthy orchard environment that supports natural pollinator populations (e.g., avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides during flowering, planting pollinator-friendly plants nearby) is generally sufficient.
    *   **Factors Affecting Pollination:** Adverse weather conditions during flowering (e.g., heavy rain, very high temperatures, strong winds) can negatively impact natural pollination and fruit set.
