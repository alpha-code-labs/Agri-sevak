Mites, including Red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) and Rust mite (Phyllocoptruta guajavae), are significant pests of Guava in Haryana, especially during dry and warm periods. Effective management involves a combination of monitoring and timely intervention.

**Monitoring and Cultural Practices:**
*   Regularly inspect the underside of leaves for webbing (red spider mite) or bronzing/russeting (rust mite).
*   Maintain proper orchard hygiene and prune affected branches if infestation is localized and severe.
*   Ensure adequate irrigation, as water stress can exacerbate mite problems.

**Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
When mite populations reach damaging levels, chemical control becomes necessary. Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage, especially the undersides of leaves. Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

Recommended CIBRC approved acaricides for Guava mites:

*   **Spiromesifen** (e.g., 22.9% SC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 0.6 ml per litre of water. This is effective against both spider mites and eriophyid mites.
*   **Fenpyroximate** (e.g., 5% EC formulation): Use at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. It provides good control against various mite species.
*   **Propargite** (e.g., 57% EC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 1.0 - 1.5 ml per litre of water. This is particularly effective against red spider mites.
*   **Wettable Sulphur** (e.g., 80% WP formulation): Use at a concentration of 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water. This is effective against rust mites and also helps in managing spider mites, especially in early stages. It also has fungicidal properties.
*   **Abamectin** (e.g., 1.9% EC formulation): Apply at a concentration of 0.5 ml per litre of water. This is effective against spider mites and has translaminar action.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Ensure complete spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where mites are most active.
*   Rotate different classes of acaricides to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the product label before harvesting fruits.
