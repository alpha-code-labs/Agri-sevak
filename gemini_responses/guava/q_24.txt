As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for Guava transplantation in Haryana:

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable time for Guava transplantation in Haryana is:

*   **Monsoon Season (July-September):** This period is ideal due to high humidity and adequate soil moisture, which significantly aids in the successful establishment and survival of young saplings.
*   **Spring Season (February-March):** This can also be considered, provided there are assured irrigation facilities to support the plants during their initial establishment phase before the onset of summer.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

The spacing for Guava plants depends on the desired planting system and variety:

*   **Traditional Planting:** For standard varieties and conventional cultivation, a spacing of **6 meters x 6 meters** is commonly recommended. This allows for optimal canopy development, air circulation, and ease of cultural operations.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** To maximize yield per unit area, HDP systems are increasingly popular.
    *   A spacing of **3 meters x 3 meters** is often adopted, especially for varieties that respond well to regular pruning.
    *   For ultra-high-density systems like the 'Meadow Orchard', spacing can be as close as **3 meters x 2 meters**, but this requires intensive pruning and management.
    *   *Note:* The choice of spacing should consider the specific variety, soil fertility, irrigation availability, and the intended pruning system.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

The transplantation process involves several critical steps to ensure successful establishment of Guava plants:

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the desired spacing, approximately 15-30 days before the actual planting.
    *   Allow the pits to remain open for a few days to expose the soil to sunlight and air, which helps in sanitizing the soil.
    *   Fill each pit with a well-mixed combination of:
        *   Topsoil (from the pit)
        *   **20-25 kg** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   **1 kg** of Single Super Phosphate (SSP).
        *   *Optional:* **50-100 g** of a suitable soil insecticide (if soil pest issues are known) and **50 g** of a fungicide (e.g., Trichoderma viride based formulation) can be mixed in the pit soil.
2.  **Selection of Saplings:**
    *   Choose healthy, vigorous, and disease-free saplings, preferably 6-12 months old.
    *   Air-layered or grafted saplings are generally preferred as they ensure early fruiting and true-to-type characteristics.
3.  **Planting:**
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or pot, ensuring the root ball remains intact and undisturbed.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the prepared pit.
    *   Ensure that the graft union (if it's a grafted plant) is positioned **5-10 cm** above the ground level to prevent scion rooting.
    *   Fill the pit with the remaining soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to eliminate air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient water retention and irrigation.
4.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Immediate Watering:** Water the newly planted saplings thoroughly immediately after planting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   **Staking:** Provide support with a sturdy bamboo stake to protect young plants from strong winds and to ensure upright growth.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) **5-10 cm** thick around the base of the plant. This helps conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young plants from grazing animals, rodents, and extreme weather conditions (e.g., by providing temporary shade during intense summer heat).
    *   **Initial Pruning:** Light pruning may be required to establish a strong framework and encourage lateral branching.
