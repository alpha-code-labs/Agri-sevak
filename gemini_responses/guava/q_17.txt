As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and biostimulants for Guava cultivation in Haryana:

The application of organic manures is crucial for improving soil health, nutrient availability, and overall plant vigor in Guava orchards. The doses vary depending on the age of the plant.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   For young plants (1-3 years old): **10-20 kg** per plant per year.
    *   For bearing plants (4 years and older): **25-50 kg** per plant per year.
    *   *Application:* Apply in two split doses, once before flowering (around February-March) and again after fruit set (around July-August), by incorporating it into the soil around the tree basin.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   For young plants (1-3 years old): **2-5 kg** per plant per year.
    *   For bearing plants (4 years and older): **5-10 kg** per plant per year.
    *   *Application:* Similar to FYM, apply in two split doses, incorporating it into the soil around the tree. Vermicompost is richer in nutrients than FYM, so lower quantities are sufficient.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Sagarika** is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes growth, and improves fruit quality.
    *   For foliar spray: **2.5-5 ml/L** of water.
    *   *Application:* Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Typically, 2-3 sprays are recommended per season.
    *   For soil application/drench: **1-2 L/acre** or **10-20 ml** per plant (diluted in sufficient water).
    *   *Application:* Can be applied as a soil drench around the root zone, especially during periods of stress or active growth.
