As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding the potential harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides on Guava (Psidium guajava). While herbicides are valuable tools for weed management, improper use can indeed lead to phytotoxicity and reduced crop vigor. The key to minimizing these effects lies in an integrated approach, prioritizing prevention and precise application.

Here's how to reduce the harmful effects of weedicides/herbicides in Guava:

### I. Integrated Weed Management (IWM) - Prioritize Non-Chemical Methods

The best way to reduce herbicide harm is to minimize their use. Incorporate the following practices:

*   **Manual Weeding:** Regular hand weeding, especially around young plants, is highly effective and completely safe for the Guava trees.
*   **Mulching:** Apply organic mulches (e.g., straw, dry leaves, wood chips, sugarcane trash) around the base of Guava trees. A 10-15 cm thick layer can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and improve soil health, significantly reducing the need for herbicides.
*   **Intercropping/Cover Cropping:** In the inter-row spaces, consider planting low-growing, non-competitive cover crops that can suppress weeds and improve soil fertility. Ensure they do not compete with Guava for nutrients or water.
*   **Mechanical Cultivation:** Shallow cultivation in the inter-row spaces can control weeds, but avoid deep tillage near the tree base to prevent root damage.

### II. Safe and Effective Herbicide Application (When Necessary)

When herbicides are deemed necessary, strict adherence to best practices is crucial to prevent harm to Guava trees.

1.  **Herbicide Selection:**
    *   **Pre-emergent Herbicides:** These are generally safer for established Guava trees as they are applied to the soil before weed emergence and prevent germination. Examples include:
        *   **Oxyfluorfen** (e.g., 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per hectare, mixed in 500-600 L water, applied as pre-emergent).
        *   **Diuron** (e.g., 1.6-3.2 kg active ingredient per hectare, mixed in 500-600 L water, applied as pre-emergent).
        *   **Simazine** (e.g., 1.0-2.0 kg active ingredient per hectare, mixed in 500-600 L water, applied as pre-emergent).
        *   **Pendimethalin** (e.g., 1.0-1.5 kg active ingredient per hectare, mixed in 500-600 L water, applied as pre-emergent).
    *   **Post-emergent Herbicides (Non-selective):** These kill existing weeds but are highly phytotoxic to Guava if they come into contact with any green part. Use with extreme caution.
        *   **Glyphosate** (e.g., 1.0-2.0 kg active ingredient per hectare, mixed in 500-600 L water, applied as directed spray).
        *   **Paraquat dichloride** (e.g., 0.5-1.0 kg active ingredient per hectare, mixed in 500-600 L water, applied as directed spray).

2.  **Application Techniques to Prevent Drift and Contact:**
    *   **Directed Spray:** This is paramount for non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate** and **Paraquat dichloride**. Use a hooded sprayer or a protective shield around the nozzle to ensure the spray only hits the weeds and does not come into contact with the Guava trunk, branches, leaves, or exposed roots.
    *   **Nozzle Selection:** Use flat-fan or flood-jet nozzles that produce larger droplets, which are less prone to drift compared to fine mist nozzles.
    *   **Weather Conditions:** Apply herbicides on calm days with minimal wind (wind speed less than 10 km/h) to prevent drift onto Guava foliage. Avoid application during hot temperatures or when rain is imminent.
    *   **Timing:** Apply pre-emergent herbicides to moist soil for better efficacy. Apply post-emergent herbicides when weeds are young and actively growing for best results and lower doses.
    *   **Dose and Concentration:** Always adhere strictly to the recommended dose and dilution rates specified on the CIBRC-approved label. Overdosing significantly increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for mixing herbicides. Hard water can sometimes reduce the efficacy of certain herbicides.
    *   **Equipment Calibration:** Regularly calibrate your sprayer to ensure accurate application rates and uniform coverage.
    *   **Age of Trees:** Avoid using herbicides, especially non-selective ones, around very young Guava plants (less than 2-3 years old) as their bark is thinner and more susceptible to damage.

3.  **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing, eye protection) during mixing and application to protect yourself.

### III. Mitigation Measures if Damage Occurs

If, despite precautions, Guava trees show signs of herbicide damage (e.g., yellowing, leaf distortion, defoliation, stunted growth):

*   **Immediate Irrigation:** If soil-applied herbicides are suspected, irrigate the affected area heavily to dilute the herbicide in the soil and leach it away from the root zone.
*   **Foliar Wash:** If foliar contact is suspected, immediately wash the affected foliage with plain water to remove residual herbicide, if possible.
*   **Nutrient Support:** Provide foliar sprays of micronutrients and a balanced NPK fertilizer to help the tree recover and boost its natural defense mechanisms.
*   **Pruning:** Remove severely damaged branches or leaves to encourage new, healthy growth.
*   **Avoid Further Stress:** Ensure the tree is well-watered and protected from other stresses (e.g., pests, diseases) during its recovery period.

By adopting an integrated approach and exercising extreme caution during herbicide application, you can effectively manage weeds in your Guava orchard while minimizing any harmful effects on the crop.
