Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with the scientifically verified information regarding guava maturity, harvesting, and cutting processes suitable for Haryana's conditions.

Here are the correct guidelines:

### Maturity Signs for Guava

Identifying the right stage of maturity is crucial for optimal fruit quality and shelf life. Look for the following indicators:

*   **Colour Change:** The most prominent sign is the change in skin colour. Mature guava fruits transition from a dark green to a lighter green, yellowish-green, or even yellow, depending on the cultivar. The fruit should not be fully yellow if intended for distant markets, but rather a light green with a yellowish tinge.
*   **Firmness:** The fruit should feel firm but yield slightly to gentle pressure. Overly hard fruits are immature, while very soft fruits are overripe.
*   **Aroma:** A characteristic, pleasant guava aroma develops as the fruit matures. This is a good indicator for fruits nearing full ripeness.
*   **Size:** The fruit should have attained its characteristic size and shape for the specific cultivar being grown.
*   **Glossiness:** The skin often develops a slight waxy sheen or glossiness.

### Harvesting Time for Guava

Guava typically has two main fruiting seasons in Haryana:

*   **Rainy Season Crop:** Fruits mature from August to September. While this crop yields more, the fruit quality (sugar content, shelf life) is generally lower due to high humidity and pest pressure.
*   **Winter Season Crop:** Fruits mature from November to March. This is the preferred crop for commercial production due to superior fruit quality, higher sugar content, better flavour, and longer shelf life.

**Optimal Time of Day for Harvesting:**
*   Harvesting should ideally be done in the **early morning** after the dew has dried, or in the **late afternoon/evening**. This helps to minimize field heat in the fruit, which is crucial for maintaining quality and extending shelf life. Avoid harvesting during the hottest part of the day.
*   The time from flowering to fruit maturity typically ranges from **90 to 120 days**, depending on the cultivar and prevailing climatic conditions.

### Cutting Process for Guava

Proper harvesting technique is essential to prevent damage and post-harvest losses.

*   **Manual Harvesting:** Guava fruits are typically harvested manually.
*   **Tools:** Use sharp, clean **secateurs or pruning shears** to cut the fruit from the branch. Avoid pulling or twisting the fruit, as this can damage the fruit, the stem, or the fruiting spur, affecting future yields.
*   **Pedicel (Stalk):** It is recommended to leave a short piece of the fruit stalk (pedicel), approximately **0.5 to 1 cm** long, attached to the fruit. This helps to prevent stem-end rot and reduces moisture loss, thereby extending the shelf life.
*   **Gentle Handling:** Handle the fruits very gently at all stages to avoid bruising, cuts, or abrasions, which can lead to rapid spoilage.
*   **Collection:** Harvested fruits should be carefully placed into padded baskets or crates to prevent damage during collection and transport. Do not drop fruits into containers.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure the harvest of high-quality guava fruits with good market value and extended shelf life.
