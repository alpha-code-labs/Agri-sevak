Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding dropping in Guava.

Firstly, regarding "Tinda/Boll dropping," **this is not known to affect Guava.** Tinda is a cucurbit vegetable, and boll dropping refers to cotton, neither of which are related to Guava.

Now, let's address flower and fruit dropping in Guava, which is a common concern for growers. Dropping can be due to various physiological, nutritional, and environmental factors.

**Common Causes of Flower and Fruit Drop in Guava:**
*   **Physiological Thinning:** Guava trees naturally shed a certain percentage of flowers and young fruits to balance the crop load and ensure the remaining fruits develop well.
*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Lack of essential micronutrients like Boron and Zinc can significantly impact flower retention and fruit set.
*   **Water Stress:** Both excessive irrigation (waterlogging) and severe drought stress during critical stages (flowering and fruit development) can lead to dropping.
*   **Hormonal Imbalance:** Imbalances in plant hormones, particularly auxins, play a crucial role in fruit abscission.
*   **Environmental Stress:** High temperatures, strong winds, or sudden changes in weather can induce stress.
*   **Pest and Disease Infestations:** Severe infestations can weaken the tree, indirectly leading to dropping.

**Control Measures for Flower and Fruit Dropping in Guava:**

**A. Agronomic and Nutritional Management (Primarily for Flower and Early Fruit Drop):**

1.  **Balanced Nutrition:**
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status. Apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
    *   **Boron Deficiency:** Boron is crucial for pollen viability and fruit set.
        *   Foliar spray of **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 0.1% (1 g/L of water) or **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 0.15% (1.5 g/L of water) during the pre-flowering and full bloom stages.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:** Zinc is vital for hormone production and overall plant growth.
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** at 0.5% (5 g/L of water) mixed with 0.25% (2.5 g/L of water) of slaked lime, or use chelated zinc as per product instructions, during the vegetative growth phase and before flowering.

2.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during flowering and fruit development.
    *   Avoid both waterlogging and severe drought stress. Irrigate regularly but moderately. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.

3.  **Proper Pruning:**
    *   Prune the trees annually to remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches. This improves light penetration, air circulation, and helps manage the crop load, reducing physiological stress.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   Regularly monitor and manage common pests (e.g., fruit fly, mealybugs) and diseases (e.g., anthracnose) that can weaken the tree and indirectly contribute to fruit drop.

**B. Hormonal Management (Primarily for Fruit Drop):**

To prevent premature fruit drop, plant growth regulators (PGRs) can be effectively used.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin is highly effective in preventing fruit abscission.
    *   Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid** (4.5% SL formulation) at a concentration of 10-20 ppm (parts per million).
    *   This translates to approximately **0.22 - 0.44 ml of Naphthalene Acetic Acid (4.5% SL) per liter of water.**
    *   **Timing:**
        *   The first spray should be given when fruits are at the pea-size stage (just after fruit set).
        *   A second spray can be applied 15-20 days after the first, if necessary, especially for varieties prone to heavy dropping.

By implementing these integrated management practices, you can significantly reduce flower and fruit dropping in your Guava orchard and ensure a healthier, more productive crop. Always ensure thorough coverage during foliar sprays.
