As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of growth regulators and micronutrients for Guava cultivation in Haryana, based on scientific research and field trials:

### Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients in Guava

**1. Ethephon (formerly known by brand name Ethrel)**
*   **Purpose:** For uniform ripening and color development of mature fruits.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation): 0.5 - 1.0 ml per liter of water (equivalent to 200-400 ppm).
*   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray 7-10 days before the anticipated harvest, when fruits have attained full size and are in the mature green stage.

**2. 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
*   **Purpose:** To prevent pre-harvest fruit drop, especially in varieties prone to shedding.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **2,4-D Sodium Salt** (80% WP formulation): 5-10 mg per liter of water (equivalent to 5-10 ppm). This translates to 0.5 - 1.0 gram per 100 liters of water.
*   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray at the pea-size fruit stage and/or approximately 4-6 weeks before the expected harvest.
*   **Important Note:** **Extreme caution is advised.** 2,4-D is also a potent herbicide at higher concentrations. Ensure precise measurement and strictly adhere to the recommended low dose to avoid phytotoxicity (damage to the plant).

**3. Boron**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient vital for pollen germination, fruit set, cell wall formation, and sugar transport. Its deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, fruit malformation, and internal browning.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)**: 1.0 - 2.0 grams per liter of water (0.1% - 0.2% solution).
*   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray. Two applications are generally recommended:
    1.  At the pre-flowering stage (bud initiation).
    2.  At the fruit set stage (when fruits are pea-sized).

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and fruits during spraying.
*   Use a spreader/sticker (surfactant) as per product recommendations to enhance efficacy.
*   Always read and follow the specific instructions and safety precautions on the product label.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and Guava variety.
