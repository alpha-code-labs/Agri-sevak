As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Guava in Haryana:

Guava (Psidium guajava) is a relatively hardy fruit crop, but proper irrigation management is crucial for optimal growth, flowering, fruit set, and yield, especially in the semi-arid climate of Haryana.

### General Irrigation Principles for Guava

*   **Critical Stages:** Guava requires adequate moisture during critical stages such as flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Water stress during these periods can lead to flower drop, poor fruit set, and reduced fruit size and quality.
*   **Soil Type:** Irrigation frequency and quantity depend heavily on soil type. Sandy soils require more frequent but lighter irrigations, while heavier clay soils can hold moisture longer and require less frequent but heavier irrigations.
*   **Climate:** Hot, dry, and windy conditions increase evapotranspiration, necessitating more frequent irrigation.
*   **Waterlogging:** Guava is highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and tree decline. Ensure good drainage.

### First Irrigation

*   **After Planting (Young Trees):**
    *   Immediately after planting the saplings, a thorough irrigation is essential to settle the soil around the roots and ensure initial establishment.
    *   For the first few months, irrigate frequently (e.g., every 3-5 days in sandy soils, every 7-10 days in heavier soils) to ensure continuous moisture for root development. The goal is to keep the root zone consistently moist but not waterlogged.
*   **Established Trees (After Dry Spell/Winter):**
    *   The first irrigation for established trees after a dry winter or a prolonged dry spell should be given at the onset of spring growth (typically February-March in Haryana) to support new flush, flowering, and fruit set for the summer crop.
    *   For the rainy season crop, irrigation is generally withheld during the monsoon period, and the first irrigation after the monsoon would be crucial for the winter crop's development, usually in September-October if rainfall is insufficient.

### Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations

*   **Frequency:**
    *   **During Fruit Development:** This is the most critical period. Irrigate every 7-15 days in light soils and every 15-25 days in heavier soils, depending on the prevailing weather conditions.
    *   **Non-Fruiting Periods:** Reduce irrigation frequency during periods of dormancy or when trees are not actively fruiting, but do not allow the soil to become completely dry, especially for young trees.
    *   **Monsoon Season:** Irrigation should be significantly reduced or withheld during the monsoon season to prevent waterlogging. Resume irrigation if there are prolonged dry spells between rain events.
*   **Quantity:** Apply enough water to wet the root zone thoroughly, typically to a depth of 60-90 cm for mature trees. Avoid excessive irrigation that leads to runoff or deep percolation beyond the root zone.
*   **Monitoring:** Observe the trees for signs of water stress (e.g., wilting leaves, dull foliage color) and check soil moisture levels regularly using simple methods like the "feel and appearance" method or moisture meters.

### Sprinkler Use in Guava

Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-irrigation systems, is highly recommended for guava cultivation in Haryana due to its water-saving efficiency and ability to deliver water precisely.

*   **Benefits of Sprinkler/Drip Irrigation:**
    *   **Water Use Efficiency:** Significantly reduces water consumption compared to flood irrigation, crucial for water-scarce regions like Haryana.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures that each tree receives an adequate and consistent amount of water.
    *   **Reduced Weed Growth:** Water is applied directly to the root zone, minimizing moisture availability for weeds in the inter-row spaces.
    *   **Fertigation:** Allows for the efficient application of water-soluble fertilizers directly to the root zone along with irrigation water, improving nutrient uptake.
    *   **Improved Soil Aeration:** Avoids waterlogging and maintains better soil aeration compared to flood irrigation.
    *   **Reduced Disease Incidence:** Keeps foliage dry, potentially reducing the incidence of some foliar diseases compared to overhead sprinklers.

*   **Recommended Systems:**
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** This is the most efficient method for guava. Emitters are placed near the base of each tree, delivering water slowly and directly to the root zone. It minimizes evaporation and deep percolation losses.
    *   **Micro-sprinklers/Mini-sprinklers:** These systems deliver water in a small, localized spray pattern around the tree. They are also highly efficient and suitable for guava orchards, especially for young trees or in areas where drip irrigation might be prone to clogging.

*   **Considerations for Sprinkler Use:**
    *   **Initial Cost:** The initial investment for setting up a drip or micro-sprinkler system can be higher than traditional methods, but long-term savings in water, labor, and increased yield often justify it.
    *   **Maintenance:** Regular cleaning of filters and emitters is necessary to prevent clogging, especially with poor water quality.
    *   **Water Quality:** Water with high salt content or suspended solids can cause clogging and may require specific filtration systems.

By adopting these irrigation management practices, guava growers in Haryana can achieve higher yields of quality fruit while optimizing water use.
