As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Guava in Haryana:

### 1. Grasshopper

Grasshoppers can cause significant damage to Guava leaves and young shoots by feeding on them. Integrated pest management strategies are recommended.

**Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   Regular monitoring of the orchard for grasshopper activity.
*   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, especially in young orchards or during initial infestation.
*   Deep ploughing during off-season can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.

**Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
For effective control, spray when grasshopper nymphs are young and active. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
*   **Malathion** (50% EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Cypermethrin** (25% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water.

### 2. Painted bug

This is not known to affect Guava. The Painted bug (*Bagrada hilaris*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

### 3. Red cotton bug

This is not known to affect Guava. The Red cotton bug (*Dysdercus cingulatus*) is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### 4. Black ants

Black ants themselves generally do not directly damage Guava plants by feeding on them. However, they are often associated with sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, as they feed on the honeydew secreted by these pests. Ants protect these sap-suckers from their natural enemies, thereby indirectly increasing the population of these harmful pests.

**Control Strategies:**

**A. Indirect Control (by managing honeydew-producing pests):**
The most effective way to manage ants in Guava is to control the sap-sucking pests they are tending.
*   **Imidacloprid** (17.8% SL) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Thiamethoxam** (25% WG) at 0.2 g/L of water.

**B. Direct Control (if ants are causing direct nuisance or nesting in critical areas):**
*   **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) at 2.5 ml/L of water, applied as a drench around the base of the tree or directly on ant trails and nests.
*   **Fipronil** (0.05% Gel bait) applied in small dots near ant trails or entry points, as per product instructions. This bait is effective in controlling ant colonies.

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Apply pesticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consider integrated pest management (IPM) approaches, combining cultural, mechanical, and biological methods with judicious use of chemicals.
