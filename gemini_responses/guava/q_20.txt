Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the importance of addressing micronutrient deficiencies for optimal Guava production in Haryana. Proper diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial.

Before applying any corrective measures, it is highly recommended to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis. This will confirm the specific deficiencies and their severity, allowing for precise and efficient nutrient management.

Here's how to address the common micronutrient deficiencies in Guava:

### General Recommendation:
Always ensure good soil organic matter content and proper drainage, as these factors significantly influence nutrient availability.

### Specific Micronutrient Deficiencies and Their Management:

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Small leaves (little leaf), rosetting of terminal leaves, reduced internodal length, interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and reduced fruit size and quality.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L) to neutralize acidity. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, starting at the new flush of growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 250-500 g of **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** per tree annually, depending on tree age and deficiency severity. This should be broadcasted around the tree basin and incorporated into the soil.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, which turn pale yellow or almost white, while veins remain distinctly green. In severe cases, leaves may become entirely white, and growth is stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous sulfate** (5-10 g/L of water) along with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L). Apply 2-3 sprays at 10-15 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** For severe cases in alkaline soils, apply **Iron chelate (e.g., Fe-EDTA)** at 50-100 g per tree, mixed with irrigation water or applied directly to the root zone. **Ferrous sulfate** can also be applied at 250-500 g per tree, but its effectiveness in high pH soils is limited.

#### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Dieback of young shoots, cracking and corkiness of fruits, internal browning, poor fruit set, and deformation of fruits. Leaves may become thick and brittle.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (1-2 g/L of water) or **Borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** (1-2 g/L of water). Apply 1-2 sprays, one before flowering and another after fruit set.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 50-100 g of **Borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** per tree every 2-3 years, depending on soil test results.

#### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** While less common as a primary deficiency in Guava compared to other crops, it can manifest as poor fruit firmness, reduced shelf life, and sometimes tip burn on young leaves or blossom end rot-like symptoms on fruits under specific conditions.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium nitrate** (5-10 g/L of water) or **Calcium chloride** (5-10 g/L of water) during fruit development. Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil calcium is low, apply **Gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate)** at 2-4 kg per tree, or **Calcium carbonate** (lime) if soil pH is also acidic.

#### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often leading to a characteristic "Christmas tree" pattern. Leaves may become brittle and prematurely drop.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Magnesium sulfate** (Epsom salt) (5-10 g/L of water). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals, especially during periods of active growth.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 250-500 g of **Magnesium sulfate** per tree annually, broadcasted around the tree basin.

#### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency
*   **Symptoms:** Similar to iron deficiency, but often appears on younger to middle-aged leaves. Interveinal chlorosis with small, scattered necrotic spots may develop. Growth can be stunted.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray 0.2-0.5% solution of **Manganese sulfate** (2-5 g/L of water) along with 0.25% unslaked lime (2.5 g/L). Apply 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply 100-250 g of **Manganese sulfate** per tree annually, if soil tests indicate severe deficiency.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Timing:** Foliar sprays are most effective when applied to young, actively growing leaves.
*   **Adjuvants:** Always use a good quality non-ionic spreader-sticker with foliar sprays to improve coverage and absorption.
*   **Water Quality:** Ensure the water used for spraying is of good quality and has a neutral pH.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Combine chemical corrections with organic matter addition, proper irrigation, and balanced NPK fertilization for long-term soil health and nutrient availability.
*   **Re-testing:** Re-test soil and leaf tissue after 1-2 years to monitor the effectiveness of the applied treatments and adjust future nutrient management plans.

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
