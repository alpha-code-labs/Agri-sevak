As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), here is the scientifically verified advice for controlling the specified pests in Guava:

### Control of Borers in Guava

Borers, including stem borers and fruit borers, can cause significant damage to Guava plants.

*   **Stem Borers (e.g., *Indarbela quadrinotata*, *Zeuzera coffeae*)**
    *   **Cultural Control:** Regularly inspect trees for boreholes and frass. Remove and destroy severely infested branches.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Inject 5-10 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) into each bore hole and immediately plug the hole with mud or wet cotton.
        *   Alternatively, inject 5-10 ml of **Dichlorvos** (76% EC) into each bore hole and plug.

*   **Fruit Borers (e.g., *Deudorix isocrates*, *Virachola isocrates*)**
    *   **Cultural Control:** Collect and destroy all infested and fallen fruits regularly. Bagging of developing fruits (when they are about 3-4 cm in diameter) with paper or cloth bags can effectively prevent infestation.
    *   **Chemical Control:**
        *   Spray with **Spinosad** (45% SC) at 0.25 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.15 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Caterpillars in Guava

Various leaf-eating caterpillars can infest Guava, causing defoliation.

*   **Cultural Control:** Hand-pick and destroy visible caterpillars in the early stages of infestation, especially on young plants.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.15 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Diamondback Moth in Guava

This is not known to affect Guava. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops.

### Control of Leaf Folder in Guava

Leaf folders (e.g., *Anarsia ephippias*) can cause leaves to fold or roll, affecting photosynthesis and plant vigor.

*   **Cultural Control:** Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
*   **Chemical Control:** Control measures are similar to those for general caterpillars, as leaf folders are a type of caterpillar.
    *   Spray with **Emamectin benzoate** (5% SG) at 0.2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) at 0.15 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Flubendiamide** (20% WG) at 0.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) at 0.5 ml/L of water.
