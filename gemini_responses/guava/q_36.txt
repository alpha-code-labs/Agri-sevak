As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice to enhance Guava yield, fruit quality, and storage life in Haryana.

It is crucial to conduct regular soil testing to determine specific nutrient deficiencies and adjust recommendations accordingly.

### I. Improving Guava Yield

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Apply NPK based on soil test results. For a mature bearing tree (5+ years), a general recommendation is 500-600 g Nitrogen (N), 200-300 g Phosphorus (P2O5), and 400-600 g Potassium (K2O) per tree per year, split into two doses (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon).
    *   **Micronutrients:** Foliar spray of **Zinc sulphate** (0.5%, i.e., 5 g/L) and **Borax** (0.2%, i.e., 2 g/L) during flowering and fruit set can significantly improve fruit set and reduce fruit drop.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate 20-30 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree annually.

2.  **Water Management:**
    *   **Timely Irrigation:** Ensure adequate moisture, especially during critical stages like flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Water stress can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Drip Irrigation:** Adopting drip irrigation can optimize water use and nutrient delivery, leading to better yield.

3.  **Pruning and Training:**
    *   **Annual Pruning:** Light pruning after the winter harvest (February-March) encourages new vegetative growth, which bears flowers and fruits. Remove dead, diseased, or criss-crossing branches.
    *   **Canopy Management:** Train trees to an open vase or modified central leader system to ensure good light penetration and air circulation, promoting uniform fruiting.

4.  **Crop Regulation:**
    *   **De-blossoming:** To avoid the low-quality, pest-prone monsoon crop and promote a high-quality winter crop, de-blossom the spring flush of flowers. This can be done manually or by spraying **Ethephon** (250-500 ppm, i.e., 0.25-0.5 ml/L of 40% Ethephon or 0.5-1 ml/L of 20% Ethephon) at the full bloom stage of the spring flush.

5.  **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):**
    *   **Fruit Retention:** To reduce premature fruit drop and improve fruit set, spray **Naphthalene acetic acid** (NAA) at 10-20 ppm (10-20 mg/L) at the full bloom stage.

### II. Improving Guava Fruit Quality

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Adequate K is crucial for fruit size, sweetness (Total Soluble Solids - TSS), and color development. Ensure sufficient K application as per soil test.
    *   **Calcium (Ca):** Foliar spray of **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1%, i.e., 5-10 g/L) during fruit development (2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals) improves fruit firmness and reduces physiological disorders.
    *   **Boron (B):** As mentioned for yield, **Borax** (0.2%) spray also aids in proper fruit development and sugar translocation, contributing to better quality.

2.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Fruit Fly:** This is a major pest affecting fruit quality. Use fruit fly traps (pheromone traps) and timely sprays of **Spinosad** (0.25 ml/L) or **Malathion** (2 ml/L) if infestation is severe, ensuring pre-harvest intervals are observed.
    *   **Anthracnose and Canker:** These diseases can severely impact fruit appearance and quality. Apply preventive sprays of **Carbendazim** (1 g/L) or **Mancozeb** (2 g/L) during fruit development, especially during humid conditions.

3.  **Crop Regulation:**
    *   As mentioned above, regulating the crop to produce fruits during the winter season (November-February) naturally results in fruits of superior quality (sweeter, firmer, fewer pests) compared to the monsoon crop.

4.  **Thinning:**
    *   If fruit set is excessively high, manual thinning of small, malformed, or diseased fruits can improve the size and quality of the remaining fruits.

### III. Improving Guava Storage Life

1.  **Pre-harvest Practices:**
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure optimal levels of Calcium and Potassium in the fruit through balanced fertilization and foliar sprays of **Calcium chloride** (1%, i.e., 10 g/L) 2-3 weeks before harvest.
    *   **Pest and Disease Control:** Effective control of pre-harvest pests and diseases prevents fruit damage that can lead to rapid spoilage.
    *   **Pre-harvest PGRs:** Spraying **Gibberellic acid** (GA3) at 50-100 ppm (50-100 mg/L) 15-20 days before harvest can delay ripening and senescence, extending shelf life.

2.  **Harvesting at Proper Maturity:**
    *   Harvest fruits at the physiological mature stage (firm, light green to yellowish-green, depending on variety) before they become fully ripe. Over-ripe fruits have a very short shelf life.
    *   Harvest early in the morning to minimize field heat.

3.  **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Washing and Sorting:** Wash fruits gently to remove dirt and latex. Sort out damaged, diseased, or immature fruits.
    *   **Hot Water Treatment (HWT):** Dipping fruits in hot water (50-55°C) for 3-5 minutes can reduce fungal infections and delay ripening.
    *   **Fungicide Dip:** To control post-harvest rots, dip fruits in a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.5 g/L) for 2-3 minutes.
    *   **Calcium Dip:** Dipping fruits in **Calcium chloride** (2-4%, i.e., 20-40 g/L) solution for 5-10 minutes can further enhance fruit firmness and reduce chilling injury during cold storage.
    *   **Edible Coatings:** Application of edible coatings (e.g., chitosan-based or wax emulsions) can reduce moisture loss, respiration rate, and delay ripening.

4.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   **Refrigeration:** Store guavas at low temperatures (8-10°C) with high relative humidity (90-95%) to significantly extend their shelf life. This can extend storage life up to 2-3 weeks depending on the variety and maturity stage.

By implementing these integrated practices, you can achieve substantial improvements in Guava yield, fruit quality, and storage life, leading to better market realization for your produce.
