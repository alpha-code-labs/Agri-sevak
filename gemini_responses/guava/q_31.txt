As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling physical damage in Guava in Haryana:

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Fruit Cracking)

Fruit bursting is a common physiological disorder in guava, primarily caused by sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (a dry spell followed by heavy irrigation or rainfall), nutrient imbalances (especially deficiencies of boron and calcium), and sometimes high humidity.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Consistent Water Management:** Maintain uniform soil moisture throughout the fruit development period.
    *   Implement regular, light irrigation rather than infrequent heavy watering.
    *   Use mulching (e.g., straw, dry leaves, black plastic) around the base of the trees to conserve soil moisture and reduce temperature fluctuations.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate availability of boron and calcium, which are crucial for cell wall integrity and fruit elasticity.
    *   Conduct soil and leaf tissue analysis to determine specific deficiencies.
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Boron:** Apply **Borax** (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 1-1.5 g/L of water or **Boric acid** at 0.5-1 g/L of water, starting from fruit set and repeating at 15-20 day intervals.
        *   **Calcium:** Apply **Calcium nitrate** at 5-7 g/L of water or **Calcium chloride** at 3-5 g/L of water, starting from fruit set and repeating at 15-20 day intervals.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil tests indicate severe deficiency, apply **Borax** at 10-15 kg/acre or **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate dihydrate) at 200-400 kg/acre (for calcium and sulfur) as per soil test recommendations.
*   **Pruning:** Light pruning to ensure good air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy can sometimes help.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burning (phytotoxicity, sunburn) and severe necrosis (which might be referred to as "melting") can occur due to various non-pathogenic factors.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and consistent water supply, especially during hot and dry periods, to prevent water stress that can lead to leaf scorch.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct soil and water analysis to avoid nutrient toxicities (e.g., excess salts, specific micronutrients) or severe deficiencies.
    *   Apply fertilizers based on recommendations, avoiding over-application, which can lead to salt burn.
*   **Pesticide Application Practices:**
    *   Always follow label instructions strictly for dosage and application timing.
    *   Avoid spraying during high temperatures (above 30-32°C) or when plants are under water stress, as this increases the risk of phytotoxicity.
    *   Ensure proper mixing and compatibility of chemicals if tank-mixing.
*   **Shade Management:** For young plants or during extreme heat waves, temporary shading can protect leaves from sunburn.
*   **Salinity Management:** If irrigation water or soil has high salinity, consider using good quality water, improving drainage, or leaching salts where feasible.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit

Hardness in guava fruit is primarily a characteristic of immaturity or specific varieties. It is not a disease or pest, but a physical quality issue.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Harvesting at Proper Maturity:** This is the most crucial factor. Guava fruits should be harvested when they reach physiological maturity, indicated by:
    *   Change in skin color from dark green to light green or yellowish-green.
    *   Development of characteristic aroma.
    *   Slight softening of the fruit (though some varieties remain firm even when ripe).
    *   Size attainment typical for the variety.
    *   Harvesting too early will result in hard, less palatable fruit.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose guava varieties known for good texture and ripening characteristics suitable for your region.
*   **Balanced Nutrition and Water:** While not directly preventing hardness, balanced nutrition and consistent water supply throughout fruit development contribute to overall fruit quality, including texture and juiciness.
