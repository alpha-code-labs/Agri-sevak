Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide guidance on managing nutrient toxicities in Guava. While deficiencies of micronutrients are more commonly observed in the generally alkaline soils of Haryana, toxicities can occur under specific soil conditions (e.g., highly acidic pockets, waterlogging, or excessive application of fertilizers).

Accurate diagnosis is paramount. Before implementing any management strategy, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis to confirm the excessive levels of these nutrients.

Here's how to manage potential toxicities of Zinc, Iron, Magnesium, and Manganese in Guava:

### General Management Principle for Micronutrient Toxicities (Zinc, Iron, Manganese)

The primary cause of excessive availability and toxicity of micronutrients like Zinc, Iron, and Manganese is often low soil pH (acidic conditions) and/or poor drainage leading to anaerobic environments. Therefore, adjusting soil pH is a key strategy.

### Specific Nutrient Management

#### 1. Zinc (Zn) Toxicity

*   **Symptoms:** Zinc toxicity can manifest as stunted growth, chlorosis (yellowing) of younger leaves, reddish-brown spots on older leaves, and necrosis (tissue death) at leaf margins. It can sometimes be confused with iron deficiency.
*   **Conditions leading to toxicity:** Highly acidic soils (pH < 5.5) or excessive application of zinc fertilizers.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Increase Soil pH:** Apply liming materials to raise the soil pH to the optimal range for Guava (typically 6.0-7.5).
        *   **Calcium carbonate** (Agricultural lime): Apply 1,000-2,000 kg/acre, depending on current pH and soil type, as per soil test recommendations.
        *   **Dolomite** (Calcium magnesium carbonate): If magnesium levels are also low or adequate, Dolomite can be used, applying 1,000-2,000 kg/acre.
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can increase zinc availability.
    *   **Avoid Further Application:** Cease all applications of zinc-containing fertilizers.
    *   **Phosphorus Application:** In some cases, applying phosphorus can help reduce zinc availability due to antagonistic interactions, but this should be done cautiously to avoid phosphorus-induced deficiencies of other nutrients.

#### 2. Iron (Fe) Toxicity

*   **Symptoms:** Iron toxicity, often called "bronzing," appears as small, dark brown or purplish spots on leaves, leading to a general bronzed appearance, especially on older leaves. Severe toxicity can cause necrosis and stunted growth.
*   **Conditions leading to toxicity:** Primarily occurs in highly acidic soils (pH < 5.0) or waterlogged conditions where anaerobic bacteria reduce ferric iron (Fe3+) to more soluble and toxic ferrous iron (Fe2+).
*   **Management:**
    *   **Improve Drainage:** This is critical. Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging and improve soil aeration.
    *   **Increase Soil pH:** Apply liming materials to raise the soil pH.
        *   **Calcium carbonate**: Apply 1,000-2,000 kg/acre, as per soil test recommendations.
        *   **Dolomite**: If magnesium levels are also low or adequate, Dolomite can be used, applying 1,000-2,000 kg/acre.
    *   **Avoid Further Application:** Stop applying iron-containing fertilizers.
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating well-decomposed organic matter can help chelate excess iron, reducing its availability.

#### 3. Magnesium (Mg) Toxicity

*   **Symptoms:** Magnesium toxicity is very rare in field conditions for Guava. Plants generally tolerate high levels of magnesium. When it does occur, it often manifests indirectly by inducing deficiencies of other cations, particularly Calcium (Ca) and Potassium (K), due to competitive uptake. Symptoms might include general stunted growth or symptoms resembling Ca or K deficiency.
*   **Conditions leading to toxicity:** Extremely high magnesium levels in the soil, often associated with specific soil types (e.g., serpentine soils), irrigation with very high Mg water, or excessive application of Mg fertilizers.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Increase Calcium Levels:** The most effective way to mitigate high magnesium is to increase the calcium content in the soil to improve the Ca:Mg ratio.
        *   **Calcium sulfate** (Gypsum): Apply 500-1,000 kg/acre to supply calcium without significantly altering pH.
        *   **Calcium chloride**: Can be used for foliar application (e.g., 2-5 g/L water) in severe cases, but soil application is more effective for long-term management.
    *   **Leaching:** If soil salinity is also an issue, leaching with good quality irrigation water can help reduce soluble magnesium levels, provided drainage is adequate.
    *   **Avoid Further Application:** Cease all applications of magnesium-containing fertilizers.

#### 4. Manganese (Mn) Toxicity

*   **Symptoms:** Manganese toxicity is characterized by chlorosis, crinkling of leaves, and the appearance of small, dark brown or purplish spots on older leaves, often starting at the margins and progressing inwards. Severe toxicity leads to marginal necrosis and stunted growth. It can also induce iron deficiency.
*   **Conditions leading to toxicity:** Highly acidic soils (pH < 5.5) where manganese becomes highly soluble and available. Waterlogging can also exacerbate manganese toxicity.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Increase Soil pH:** This is the most effective method to reduce manganese availability.
        *   **Calcium carbonate**: Apply 1,000-2,000 kg/acre, as per soil test recommendations.
        *   **Dolomite**: If magnesium levels are also low or adequate, Dolomite can be used, applying 1,000-2,000 kg/acre.
    *   **Improve Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent anaerobic conditions.
    *   **Avoid Further Application:** Stop applying manganese-containing fertilizers.
    *   **Silicon Application:** Some studies suggest that silicon application can help alleviate manganese toxicity by promoting its compartmentalization in plant tissues. However, this is a more advanced strategy and should be considered after basic pH adjustment.
