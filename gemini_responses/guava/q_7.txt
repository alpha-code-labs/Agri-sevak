As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Guava, specifically for the conditions in Haryana:

### Control of Dieback in Guava

Dieback is a serious disease in guava, often caused by fungi like *Colletotrichum psidii* (formerly *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*). It leads to the drying and blackening of twigs and branches, starting from the tip and progressing downwards.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly prune all affected, dead, or diseased twigs and branches well below the infected portion. Ensure pruning cuts are clean and smooth.
    *   Apply a fungicidal paste (e.g., Bordeaux paste or a paste made with a systemic fungicide) on the cut ends immediately after pruning to prevent re-infection.
    *   Maintain proper orchard sanitation by removing and destroying all pruned material.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition and adequate irrigation to keep trees healthy and vigorous, as stressed trees are more susceptible.
    *   Avoid waterlogging conditions.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   After pruning, spray the trees thoroughly with a suitable fungicide. Repeat sprays may be necessary, especially during humid conditions or disease outbreaks.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.

### Control of Twig Blight in Guava

Twig blight in guava is often caused by similar pathogens as dieback, such as *Colletotrichum psidii* or *Pestalotiopsis psidii*. The symptoms are characterized by the browning and drying of young twigs and leaves, leading to defoliation and dieback of affected branches.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Similar to dieback, regular inspection and prompt removal of infected twigs and branches are crucial. Prune at least 15-20 cm below the visible symptoms.
    *   Sanitize pruning tools with a disinfectant (e.g., 1% sodium hypochlorite solution) between cuts to prevent disease spread.
    *   Maintain good air circulation within the canopy through judicious pruning.
    *   Ensure proper nutrient management and irrigation to enhance tree vigor.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Fungicidal sprays are effective in managing twig blight, especially after pruning and during periods conducive to disease development.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** (50% WP) at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   **Carbendazim** (50% WP) at 1.0-1.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Mancozeb** (75% WP) at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.

### Control of Tikka Disease in Guava

Tikka disease, as commonly referred to in agriculture, is primarily a major foliar disease of groundnut (peanut) caused by *Cercospora arachidicola* and *Phaeoisariopsis personata*.

**This is not known to affect Guava.**

While *Cercospora* species can cause leaf spots on various plants, including guava (often referred to as *Cercospora* leaf spot), the specific term "Tikka disease" is not used for guava. If you are observing general leaf spots on guava, the fungicidal sprays recommended for Dieback and Twig Blight (e.g., **Mancozeb** or **Carbendazim**) would generally help in managing such foliar diseases.
