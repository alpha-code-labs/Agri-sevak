As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fruit flies and addressing Ber fly in Guava cultivation in Haryana:

**Ber Fly (Carpomyia vesuviana):**
This is not known to affect Guava. The Ber fly is a specific pest of Ber (Ziziphus mauritiana).

**Fruit Fly (Bactrocera dorsalis complex) in Guava:**
Fruit flies are a major pest of Guava, causing significant damage by laying eggs in developing fruits, leading to maggot infestation and fruit rot. An integrated approach is essential for effective management.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen and infested fruits by burying them deep in the soil (at least 60 cm) or immersing them in water to kill the maggots and pupae. This is the most critical step.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing of the orchard soil exposes fruit fly pupae to predators and adverse weather conditions, reducing their population.
*   **Bagging of Fruits:** Individual bagging of developing fruits (when they are marble-sized) with paper or cloth bags can effectively prevent fruit fly oviposition. This is highly effective for small-scale orchards.

**2. Pheromone Traps:**
*   **Methyl Eugenol Traps:** Install pheromone traps containing methyl eugenol lure at a density of 10-15 traps per acre. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, disrupting their breeding cycle. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

**3. Bait Sprays:**
Bait sprays are highly effective and target-specific, reducing the need for broad-spectrum insecticide application. They consist of an insecticide mixed with a protein source (attractant).
*   Prepare a bait solution by mixing:
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water
    *   OR **Spinosad** 45% SC at 0.25 ml/L of water
    *   AND a protein source like jaggery (20 g/L) or protein hydrolysate (5 g/L).
*   Spot spray this bait solution on the foliage (not on fruits) of 10-15 trees per acre, preferably in the morning hours. Repeat every 7-10 days, especially during fruit development.

**4. Chemical Control (as a last resort for severe infestations):**
If infestation is severe and other methods are insufficient, judicious application of insecticides may be necessary. Always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the product label.
*   **Malathion** 50% EC: 2 ml/L of water.
*   **Deltamethrin** 2.8% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.
*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC: 0.5 ml/L of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) strictly to avoid pesticide residues in fruits.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
