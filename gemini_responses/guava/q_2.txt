As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding rust diseases in Guava for Haryana.

It is important to clarify that most of the rust diseases you mentioned are not known to affect Guava.

1.  **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** This is not known to affect Guava. Black rust, typically caused by *Puccinia graminis*, primarily affects cereal crops like wheat, barley, and rye.
2.  **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** This is not known to affect Guava. Brown rust, typically caused by *Puccinia triticina*, primarily affects cereal crops like wheat.
3.  **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** This is not known to affect Guava. Yellow rust, typically caused by *Puccinia striiformis*, primarily affects cereal crops like wheat and barley.
4.  **White Rust:** This is not known to affect Guava. White rust, caused by *Albugo* species, primarily affects cruciferous vegetables, sweet potato, spinach, and other specific plant families.
5.  **Red Rust:** This condition *does* affect Guava. Red rust is caused by *Cephaleuros virescens*, which is an algal pathogen, not a true fungus. It is common in humid tropical and subtropical regions.

**Control of Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*) in Guava**

Red rust manifests as reddish-brown, velvety spots on leaves, twigs, and sometimes fruits. Severe infections can lead to defoliation, twig dieback, and reduced fruit quality.

**1. Cultural and Horticultural Practices:**

*   **Pruning:** Regularly prune affected branches and twigs. Remove dead or diseased wood to improve air circulation within the canopy and reduce humidity.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all fallen leaves and infected plant parts to reduce the inoculum source.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization. Adequate potassium levels can enhance plant vigor and resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the orchard floor free of weeds to reduce humidity around the plants.
*   **Plant Spacing:** Maintain proper plant spacing to ensure good air movement and sunlight penetration, which helps in drying leaf surfaces.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, to minimize prolonged leaf wetness. Drip irrigation is preferred.
*   **Shade Management:** Reduce excessive shade, as shaded conditions favor the development of red rust.

**2. Chemical Control:**

For effective control, especially during periods of high humidity or when symptoms appear, fungicidal sprays can be applied. Since *Cephaleuros virescens* is an alga, copper-based fungicides are particularly effective.

*   **Foliar Sprays:**
    *   Spray with **Copper oxychloride** at a concentration of 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, you can use **Mancozeb** at a concentration of 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.

*   **Application:**
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, especially the undersides of leaves and twigs.
    *   Repeat sprays at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions, particularly during periods of high humidity.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety precautions when handling and applying any chemical.
