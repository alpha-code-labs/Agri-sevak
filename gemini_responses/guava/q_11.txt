Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective and sustainable control of pests in Guava orchards.

Here's how to manage Beetles and Weevils in Guava:

**1. Beetles and Weevils (General Management)**

These pests can cause damage by feeding on leaves, bark, and fruits. Specific examples include Guava Fruit Weevil, Bark Eating Caterpillar (larvae of a moth, but often grouped with borers), and various defoliating beetles.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen, infested fruits and plant debris.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy any dead, diseased, or infested branches.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Plough the soil around the trees during winter to expose and destroy pupae of soil-dwelling beetles and weevils.
*   **Fruit Bagging:** For fruit-infesting weevils and borers, bag individual fruits with paper or cloth bags once they reach marble size. This is highly effective for quality fruit production.
*   **Hand Picking:** Collect and destroy adult beetles and weevils, especially during early morning hours.

**B. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals as per recommendations):**

*   **For Fruit Weevils and Defoliating Beetles:**
    *   Spray at fruit set stage or upon observing pest incidence.
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 2 ml/L of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of foliage and developing fruits. Repeat sprays may be necessary based on pest pressure and pre-harvest interval (PHI) of the chemical.

*   **For Bark Eating Caterpillar/Beetle (Stem Borers):**
    *   Identify boreholes and remove the silken webs.
    *   Inject a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC (diluted 1:1 with water) into the boreholes using a syringe.
    *   Immediately plug the holes with wet mud or cotton to trap the fumes.

**2. Sawflies**
