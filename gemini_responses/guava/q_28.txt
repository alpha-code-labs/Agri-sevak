As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by environmental extremes to Guava cultivation in our region. Protecting Guava trees from these stresses is crucial for maintaining their health, productivity, and fruit quality. Here's scientifically verified advice to mitigate the effects of extreme cold, frost, heat (Loo), and intense sunlight:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Guava is sensitive to frost, especially young plants and new flushes.

*   **Pre-Frost Irrigation:** Lightly irrigate the orchard in the evening before a predicted frost event. The water releases latent heat as it freezes, which can raise the ambient temperature around the trees and protect the root zone.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** For young guava plants (up to 2-3 years old), cover them with straw, gunny bags, or plastic sheets during cold nights. Ensure the cover does not directly touch the foliage. Remove covers during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.
*   **Smudging/Smoking:** In small orchards, creating smoke by burning biomass (such as crop residue or dry leaves) on the upwind side of the orchard can help create a warm air blanket, preventing temperature inversion and frost formation. This should be done carefully to avoid fire hazards.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant tall, dense trees (e.g., Eucalyptus, Poplar) on the northern and western sides of the orchard to act as windbreaks, reducing the impact of cold, dry winds.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure adequate **Potassium** levels in the soil. Potassium helps improve the plant's cell sap concentration, increasing its tolerance to cold. A foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** (10 g/L water) can be applied before the onset of severe cold to enhance resilience.
*   **Avoid Pruning:** Do not prune guava trees just before winter, as new flushes are highly susceptible to frost damage.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, hot dry winds (Loo), and intense sunlight can cause sunscald, desiccation, and reduced fruit set and quality.

*   **Frequent Light Irrigation:** During hot periods, provide light and frequent irrigation to maintain optimal soil moisture. This helps cool the plant canopy through evapotranspiration and prevents water stress. Avoid waterlogging.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash, paddy straw) around the base of the trees. Mulch helps conserve soil moisture, reduces soil temperature, and suppresses weeds.
*   **Windbreaks:** As mentioned for cold, windbreaks also protect against hot, dry "Loo" winds, reducing desiccation and physical damage to the trees and fruits.
*   **Shade Nets:** For young plants, or even mature trees in extremely exposed areas, installing 30-50% shade nets can significantly reduce heat and sun stress, protecting foliage and developing fruits from direct scorching.
*   **White Washing/Trunk Painting:** Paint the main trunk and lower branches with a lime wash (calcium carbonate solution) or a white acrylic paint diluted with water. This reflects sunlight, preventing sunscald on the bark and reducing the internal temperature of the trunk.
*   **Foliar Application of Kaolin Clay:** Spraying a solution of **Kaolin clay** (50 g/L water) on the foliage can create a reflective white film. This film reduces leaf temperature, reflects harmful UV radiation, and decreases water loss through transpiration. Repeat application might be needed after heavy rain.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. Adequate **Potassium** helps improve water use efficiency and heat tolerance. A foliar spray of **Potassium nitrate** (10 g/L water) can be beneficial during periods of high heat stress.
*   **Canopy Management:** Maintain a healthy, dense canopy through proper pruning techniques. A well-managed canopy provides natural shade to developing fruits and branches, preventing sunscald while ensuring adequate air circulation.
