As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for seed and soil treatment processes for Guava in Haryana.

It is important to note that Guava is predominantly propagated vegetatively (e.g., by grafting, budding, or air layering) for commercial cultivation to ensure true-to-type plants and early fruiting. Seed propagation is primarily used for raising rootstock or for breeding purposes. However, if seeds are used, treatment is crucial.

### Seed Treatment Process for Guava

When Guava seeds are used, seed treatment is essential to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens, particularly those causing damping-off, and to improve germination and early seedling vigour.

*   **Fungicidal Treatment:**
    *   Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** at 2 grams per kilogram of seed.
    *   Alternatively, treat seeds with **Thiram** at 2.5 grams per kilogram of seed.
*   **Biological Treatment:**
    *   After fungicidal treatment (or as a standalone treatment if organic cultivation is preferred), treat seeds with a bio-fungicide like **Trichoderma viride** at 5-10 grams per kilogram of seed. Allow the seeds to dry in the shade before sowing. This helps in suppressing soil-borne diseases and promoting root development.

### Soil Treatment Process for Guava

Soil treatment for Guava is critical, especially for managing soil-borne diseases like Guava Wilt (caused by *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *psidii*) and nematode infestations, which are major concerns in Guava cultivation.

**1. Pre-Planting Soil Treatment (for new orchards):**

*   **Soil Solarization:** In areas with high incidence of soil-borne diseases and nematodes, soil solarization during the hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce pathogen and nematode populations. This involves covering moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets.
*   **Organic Amendments:**
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at 20-30 tonnes per acre into the soil during land preparation.
    *   Apply **Neem cake** at 200-400 kilograms per acre and thoroughly mix it into the soil. Neem cake acts as a natural nematicide and provides slow-release nutrients.
*   **Biological Treatment:**
    *   Apply **Trichoderma viride** at 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with 50-100 kg of FYM or compost, and incorporate into the soil before planting.
    *   Apply **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 2.5 kilograms per acre, similarly mixed with FYM, for broad-spectrum disease suppression and plant growth promotion.
    *   For known nematode problems, apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) at 2.5 kilograms per acre, mixed with FYM, and incorporate into the planting pits or entire field.

**2. Soil Treatment for Established Orchards:**

*   **Management of Guava Wilt:**
    *   **Biological Control:** Drench the soil around the root zone of affected or susceptible plants with a suspension of **Trichoderma viride** at 5 grams per litre of water, or **Pseudomonas fluorescens** at 5 grams per litre of water. Repeat this application every 3-4 months, especially during monsoon and post-monsoon periods.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Regularly apply **Neem cake** at 1-2 kilograms per plant around the root zone, once or twice a year, especially before the monsoon.
*   **Nematode Management:**
    *   **Biological Nematicides:** Apply **Purpureocillium lilacinum** at 50-100 grams per plant, mixed with FYM, around the root zone and lightly incorporate into the soil. Repeat annually or as needed based on nematode population monitoring.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Continue regular application of **Neem cake** as mentioned above.
*   **General Soil Health:**
    *   Regularly incorporate organic matter and apply bio-fertilizers (e.g., Azotobacter, PSB) to maintain soil health and microbial activity, which naturally suppresses many soil-borne issues.

These treatments, when implemented correctly, will contribute significantly to the health and productivity of your Guava orchard.
