As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling soil pests like termites and nematodes (specifically root-knot) in Wheat in Haryana.

### Control of Termites in Wheat

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) are a significant soil pest in wheat, especially in light soils and rainfed conditions, causing damage by feeding on roots and germinating seeds.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Termites:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes termite colonies to predators and sun, disrupting their nests.
    *   **Removal of Stubble and Weeds:** Reduces food sources for termites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Termites prefer dry conditions; adequate moisture can deter them.
    *   **Application of Well-Decomposed FYM:** Avoid using undecomposed organic matter, which can attract termites.

2.  **Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approved recommendations):**
    *   **Seed Treatment (Recommended for preventive control):**
        *   Treat seeds before sowing with:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 4 ml per kg of seed.
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC** at 6 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Soil Application (Pre-sowing or at sowing, if infestation is high):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2-2.5 Litres per acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of sand or dry soil and broadcast evenly before the last ploughing, or apply through irrigation water.
        *   **Fipronil 0.3% GR** at 6-8 kg per acre. Apply uniformly in the soil at the time of sowing.

### Control of Nematodes (Root-knot) in Wheat

While cereal cyst nematode (*Heterodera avenae*) is a more common and significant nematode problem in wheat in Haryana, root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) can also affect wheat, particularly in fields with a history of susceptible crops.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Root-knot Nematodes (Primary Recommendation):**

Chemical control for root-knot nematodes in wheat is generally not the primary recommendation due to economic viability and environmental concerns, especially in broad-acre cultivation. Emphasis is placed on cultural and biological methods.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** This is the most effective method. Rotate wheat with non-host crops such as mustard, sorghum, pearl millet, marigold, or fallow periods. Avoid continuous cultivation of susceptible crops.
    *   **Deep Summer Ploughing:** Exposes nematode eggs and larvae to heat and desiccation, reducing their population.
    *   **Application of Organic Amendments:** Incorporate 5-10 tonnes per acre of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost. This improves soil health and promotes beneficial soil microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
    *   **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** While specific root-knot resistant wheat varieties are less common than for cereal cyst nematode, choosing varieties known to perform well in nematode-infested areas can help.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Seed treatment or soil application of bio-nematicides containing fungi like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* can help suppress nematode populations.

3.  **Chemical Control (Only if infestation is severe and cultural methods are insufficient, and as per specific local recommendations):**
    *   If chemical intervention is deemed absolutely necessary and approved for the specific situation, a nematicide like:
        *   **Carbofuran 3% G** at 33 kg per acre can be applied in furrows at the time of sowing. (Note: The use of such granular nematicides is often restricted or discouraged due to environmental and health concerns, and should only be considered after careful evaluation and consultation with agricultural experts).

Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
