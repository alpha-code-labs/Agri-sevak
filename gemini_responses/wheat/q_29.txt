This is not known to affect Wheat.

The terms "Flower drop," "Fruit drop," "Tinda dropping," and "Boll dropping" are typically associated with horticultural crops (like vegetables and fruits) or fibre crops (like cotton), where distinct flowers, fruits, or bolls are formed and can abscise.

Wheat is a cereal crop where florets develop into grains (caryopses) within spikelets. While wheat can experience issues like poor grain filling, sterility, or premature shriveling of grains due to various abiotic (e.g., heat stress, water stress, nutrient deficiencies) or biotic (e.g., diseases, pests) factors, these phenomena are not referred to as "dropping" in the context of flower, fruit, or boll abscission.
