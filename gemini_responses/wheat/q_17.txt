As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures for Wheat cultivation in Haryana to improve soil health, nutrient availability, and crop yield:

It is crucial to incorporate organic manures into the soil well before sowing to allow for decomposition and nutrient release.

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 8-10 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Apply 2-3 weeks before sowing and thoroughly incorporate into the soil during field preparation. Well-decomposed FYM is preferred to avoid weed issues and nutrient immobilization.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Recommended Dose:** 2-3 tonnes per acre.
    *   **Application:** Can be applied at the time of final land preparation and incorporated into the soil, or as a top dressing during early growth stages.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract-based Biostimulant):**
    *   **Nature:** Sagarika is a seaweed extract-based biostimulant, not a bulk organic manure like FYM or vermicompost. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves stress tolerance.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** 250-500 ml per acre, diluted in 150-200 litres of water.
        *   **Application Timing:** Typically applied twice during the crop cycle:
            1.  First spray at tillering stage (25-30 days after sowing).
            2.  Second spray at booting/flowering stage (60-70 days after sowing).
    *   **Note:** This product is used as a supplement to conventional nutrient management and organic manures, not as a replacement for bulk organic matter.
