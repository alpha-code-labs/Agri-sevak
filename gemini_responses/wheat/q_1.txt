As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling smut diseases in wheat, specifically addressing the terms you've used:

First, let's clarify the terminology:

*   **False Smut:** This is not known to affect Wheat. False Smut (caused by *Ustilaginoidea virens*) is primarily a disease of rice.
*   **Black Smut:** This is not a standard scientific name for a wheat disease. It might be a colloquial term for Loose Smut or Bunt (Stinking Smut/Covered Smut) due to the black spore masses. I will focus on the scientifically recognized smuts.
*   **Kernel Smut:** This term most commonly refers to **Karnal Bunt** (caused by *Neovossia indica* or *Tilletia indica*), a significant disease in wheat, especially in Haryana.
*   **Loose Smut:** (caused by *Ustilago tritici*) is a very common and important wheat disease.

Therefore, I will provide control measures for **Loose Smut** and **Karnal Bunt (Kernel Smut)**.

### Control of Loose Smut (Ustilago tritici) in Wheat

Loose smut is an internally seed-borne disease. The fungus infects the embryo of the developing seed, but the seed appears healthy. The disease manifests only when the infected seed germinates and grows into a plant, replacing the grain in the ear with a mass of black spores.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Use of Resistant Varieties:** Plant varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to loose smut. Consult HAU for the latest recommended varieties for Haryana.
2.  **Seed Treatment:** This is the most effective and crucial control measure for loose smut. Treat seeds with systemic fungicides before sowing.
    *   **Carboxin** 75% WP: 2.0 g/kg seed
    *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% DS: 2.5 g/kg seed
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS: 1.0 g/kg seed
    *   **Difenoconazole** 3% FS: 1.0 ml/kg seed
    *   **Flutriafol** 2.5% + **Thiophanate Methyl** 22.5% FS: 1.0 ml/kg seed
    *   **Tebuconazole** 60 FS: 0.5 ml/kg seed
    *   **Triadimenol** 25 WP: 1.0 g/kg seed
3.  **Rouging:** Remove and destroy infected plants before the spores are dispersed to prevent further spread.

### Control of Karnal Bunt (Kernel Smut) (Neovossia indica / Tilletia indica) in Wheat

Karnal Bunt is primarily a soil-borne disease, but spores can also adhere to the seed surface. It is characterized by partial infection of individual kernels, turning them into a black, powdery mass with a characteristic fishy smell.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Use of Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** Plant varieties that show resistance or tolerance to Karnal Bunt. HAU provides recommendations for such varieties suitable for Haryana.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous wheat cultivation in fields with a history of Karnal Bunt. Rotate with non-host crops.
    *   **Deep Ploughing:** Deep ploughing during summer can help bury the teliospores (resting spores) in the soil, reducing their viability.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can increase disease severity. Maintain a balanced NPK ratio.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid frequent irrigations, especially during the flowering and grain-filling stages, as high humidity favors disease development.
3.  **Seed Treatment:** While primarily soil-borne, seed treatment can help control surface-borne spores.
    *   **Carboxin** 75% WP: 2.0 g/kg seed
    *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS: 1.0 g/kg seed
4.  **Foliar Fungicide Application:** In areas with a history of severe Karnal Bunt, or if weather conditions are conducive for disease development (high humidity, moderate temperatures) during the critical growth stages (boot to heading stage), a foliar spray can be effective.
    *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: 500 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: 250 ml/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Triadimefon** 25% WP: 200 g/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   Apply the spray at the boot stage (when the flag leaf emerges and the ear is still enclosed in the leaf sheath) and repeat if necessary, depending on disease pressure and weather conditions.

Always ensure proper calibration of spray equipment and follow label instructions for all chemical applications. For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions, please consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar.
