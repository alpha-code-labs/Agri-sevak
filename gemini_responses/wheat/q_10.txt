As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Wheat in Haryana:

---

**1. Borers (e.g., Shoot fly, Pink Stem Borer)**

In wheat, "borer" damage is primarily caused by pests like the shoot fly (Atherigona naqvii) in early stages, leading to "dead heart" symptoms, and occasionally by pink stem borer (Sesamia inferens).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Timely sowing of wheat varieties.
    *   Removal of alternate host plants and weeds from field bunds.
    *   Balanced fertilization to promote vigorous plant growth.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Seed Treatment (for early season protection against shoot fly):**
        *   **Thiamethoxam** 70 WS @ 3 g per kg of seed.
        *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS @ 7 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Foliar Spray (if infestation is observed after emergence):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC @ 500 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Fipronil** 5 SC @ 400 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

**2. Caterpillars (e.g., Armyworms, Cutworms)**

Armyworms (Mythimna separata) and cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon) are common caterpillar pests in wheat, especially during specific growth stages or under certain environmental conditions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Deep summer ploughing to expose pupae and larvae to predators and sunlight.
    *   Removal of weeds that can serve as alternate hosts.
    *   Monitoring fields regularly, especially during evening hours for cutworm activity.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Cutworms (soil application/drenching):**
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC @ 1 litre per acre mixed with 200-300 litres of water, applied as a drench near the plant base or mixed with sand and broadcast in the evening.
    *   **For Armyworms (foliar spray):**
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC @ 100 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Emamectin benzoate** 5 SG @ 80 g per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC @ 500 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

**3. Diamondback Moth (DBM)**

This is not known to affect Wheat. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

**4. Leaf Folder**

This is not known to affect Wheat as a significant pest. Leaf folders (*Cnaphalocrocis medinalis*) are primarily pests of rice.

**Important Note:** Always consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the current pest situation, as pest incidence and recommended practices can vary. Ensure proper safety measures are followed while handling and applying pesticides.
