As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I emphasize that efficient irrigation management is paramount for maximizing wheat yield and water use efficiency in Haryana. Wheat has several critical growth stages where water availability directly impacts productivity.

### Irrigation Management in Wheat

**General Principles:**
The total number of irrigations required for wheat typically ranges from 4 to 6, depending on the soil type, rainfall received during the cropping season, and the specific wheat variety. The timing of irrigation is more crucial than the number of irrigations.

#### 1. First Irrigation

*   **Critical Stage:** Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage. This is the most critical stage for irrigation in wheat.
*   **Timing:** Approximately 21-25 days after sowing (DAS).
*   **Importance:** Water availability at CRI is vital for the development of the crown roots, which are the primary nutrient and water absorbing roots. It also promotes tillering and ensures robust plant establishment.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   A light irrigation is recommended at this stage.
    *   In sandy soils, or if the sowing was done in dry soil, the first irrigation might be needed slightly earlier (around 18-20 DAS).
    *   Delaying the first irrigation beyond 25 DAS can significantly reduce tillering and overall yield.
    *   Avoid heavy irrigation that can lead to waterlogging, especially in heavy soils, as it can hinder root respiration and nutrient uptake.

#### 2. Second Irrigation

*   **Critical Stage:** Tillering / Late Tillering to Jointing stage.
*   **Timing:** Approximately 40-45 days after sowing (DAS), or about 20-25 days after the first irrigation.
*   **Importance:** This irrigation supports vigorous tillering, stem elongation, and prepares the plant for the reproductive stages. Adequate moisture at this stage ensures the development of strong tillers that will bear productive ears.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Ensure the soil has sufficient moisture to support the rapid growth phase.
    *   Monitor soil moisture levels; if there has been significant rainfall, this irrigation might be delayed or skipped.

#### Subsequent Irrigations (General)

Other critical stages for irrigation include:
*   **Boot Stage:** Approximately 60-65 DAS. Essential for ear development inside the leaf sheath.
*   **Flowering Stage:** Approximately 80-85 DAS. Crucial for successful pollination and fertilization.
*   **Grain Filling Stage (Milk/Dough Stage):** Approximately 100-110 DAS. Ensures proper grain development and plumpness, directly impacting yield and grain quality.

Water stress at any of these critical stages can lead to significant yield losses.

#### 3. Sprinkler Use in Wheat

Sprinkler irrigation, particularly micro-sprinklers or rain guns, offers significant advantages over traditional flood irrigation in wheat cultivation, especially in water-scarce regions of Haryana.

*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Water Saving:** Sprinkler systems can save 30-50% of water compared to flood irrigation, leading to higher water use efficiency.
    *   **Uniform Water Distribution:** Ensures even application of water across the field, leading to uniform crop growth and yield.
    *   **Reduced Nutrient Leaching:** Minimizes deep percolation losses of water and soluble nutrients, making them more available to the crop.
    *   **Suitable for Undulating Terrain:** Can be effectively used on uneven land where flood irrigation is difficult or inefficient.
    *   **Energy Saving:** Often requires less pumping time due to lower water application rates.
    *   **Improved Fertilizer Use Efficiency:** Facilitates fertigation (application of fertilizers through irrigation water), allowing for precise nutrient delivery.
    *   **Reduced Soil Erosion:** Gentle application prevents soil erosion, especially on sloped fields.

*   **Applicability in Wheat:**
    *   Sprinklers are highly effective for wheat, allowing for light and frequent irrigations that match the crop's water requirements more precisely.
    *   They are particularly beneficial in sandy soils where water infiltration rates are high and flood irrigation can lead to significant percolation losses.
    *   The initial investment cost can be a barrier, but government subsidies and long-term water and energy savings often make it a viable and sustainable option.

*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Wind Drift:** Strong winds can affect the uniformity of water distribution.
    *   **Clogging:** Nozzles can get clogged if the water source is not clean, requiring regular maintenance.
    *   **Initial Investment:** Higher upfront cost compared to traditional methods.

By adopting these scientifically sound irrigation practices, farmers in Haryana can optimize water use, enhance wheat productivity, and contribute to sustainable agriculture.
