As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice to improve yield, grain quality, and storage life for wheat in Haryana.

Firstly, it is important to clarify that wheat produces grains (caryopses), not fleshy fruits in the common agricultural sense. Therefore, "fruit quality" for wheat will be addressed as "grain quality."

### Improving Yield for Wheat

To maximize wheat yield, a holistic approach covering various aspects of crop management is essential:

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties recommended for Haryana by HAU or ICAR, suitable for your specific agro-climatic zone and sowing time. Examples include WH 1105, HD 3086, DBW 187, DBW 222, WH 1270, etc.
2.  **Timely Sowing:**
    *   Optimal sowing time (mid-November to early December for timely sown wheat) is crucial for proper crop establishment and tillering. Late sowing significantly reduces yield.
3.  **Nutrient Management (Based on Soil Test):**
    *   **Nitrogen (N):** Apply N in splits. A common recommendation is 150 kg N/acre. Apply 1/3rd at sowing, 1/3rd at first irrigation (21-25 DAS), and 1/3rd at second irrigation (40-45 DAS).
    *   **Phosphorus (P):** Apply 60 kg P2O5/acre as basal at sowing.
    *   **Potassium (K):** Apply 40 kg K2O/acre as basal at sowing, especially on light-textured soils or where soil test indicates deficiency.
    *   **Micronutrients:**
        *   **Zinc (Zn):** If soil test indicates deficiency, apply 10 kg **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** (21% Zn) per acre as basal or spray 0.5% solution (500 g **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** in 100 L water) twice at tillering and flag leaf stage.
        *   **Manganese (Mn):** In deficient soils (often sandy soils), spray 0.5% solution (500 g **Manganese sulphate** in 100 L water) 2-3 times at weekly intervals starting from 30-35 DAS.
4.  **Water Management (Irrigation):**
    *   Provide 4-6 irrigations depending on soil type and rainfall. Critical stages are:
        *   Crown Root Initiation (CRI): 21-25 DAS
        *   Tillering: 40-45 DAS
        *   Jointing: 60-65 DAS
        *   Flowering: 80-85 DAS
        *   Milking: 100-105 DAS
        *   Dough Stage: 115-120 DAS
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Weeds compete heavily for nutrients and water.
    *   **Narrow-leaved weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor, Avena ludoviciana):** Apply **Clodinafop-propargyl** 60 g/acre or **Sulfosulfuron** 10 g/acre at 30-35 DAS.
    *   **Broad-leaved weeds (e.g., Chenopodium album, Melilotus indica):** Apply **2,4-D ethyl ester** 250 g/acre or **Metribuzin** 75 g/acre at 30-35 DAS.
    *   For mixed weed flora, use combination products or sequential application.
6.  **Pest and Disease Management:**
    *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with **Carbendazim** 1 g/kg seed + **Thiram** 2 g/kg seed or **Tebuconazole** 1.5 ml/kg seed to protect against seed-borne diseases and early seedling blight.
    *   **Termites:** If a problem, apply **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2 L/acre with first irrigation.
    *   **Aphids:** If infestation is severe, spray **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 50-75 ml/acre or **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG at 50 g/acre.
    *   **Rusts (Yellow, Brown):** If symptoms appear, spray **Propiconazole** 25 EC at 200 ml/acre or **Tebuconazole** 250 EC at 200 ml/acre.
    *   **Karnal Bunt:** Use resistant varieties. If susceptible varieties are grown in endemic areas, spray **Propiconazole** 25 EC at 200 ml/acre at ear emergence stage.

### Improving Grain Quality (Addressing "Fruit Quality") for Wheat

Grain quality refers to parameters like test weight, protein content, milling and baking characteristics, and freedom from shriveling, discoloration, or foreign matter.

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties known for good grain quality, high protein content, and desirable milling/baking characteristics, in addition to high yield.
2.  **Balanced Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Nitrogen:** Adequate nitrogen, especially a late application (e.g., 1/3rd at second irrigation), is crucial for improving protein content in grains.
    *   **Sulphur (S):** Sulphur plays a vital role in protein synthesis. Apply 10 kg S/acre through **Gypsum** or **Bentonite Sulphur** at sowing, especially in deficient soils.
3.  **Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Avoid water stress, particularly during grain filling stages (milking to dough stage), as it can lead to shriveled grains and reduced test weight.
4.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Effective control of foliar diseases (rusts, blights) and insect pests (aphids, armyworms) prevents damage to the flag leaf and developing grains, ensuring plump, healthy grains.
5.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest wheat when grains reach physiological maturity (around 12-14% moisture content). Early harvesting leads to immature, shriveled grains, while delayed harvesting can cause shattering, lodging, and quality deterioration due to weather exposure.

### Improving Storage Life for Wheat

Proper post-harvest management is critical to prevent losses and maintain grain quality during storage.

1.  **Proper Drying:**
    *   Grains must be dried to a safe moisture content of 10-12% before storage. Higher moisture content promotes fungal growth and insect infestation.
2.  **Cleanliness of Storage Structures:**
    *   Thoroughly clean and disinfect storage bins, godowns, or bags before storing new grain. Remove all old grain, dust, and debris. Repair cracks and crevices.
    *   Spray empty godowns with **Malathion** 50 EC at 1 part in 100 parts of water (1 L in 100 L water) 2-3 weeks before storing grains.
3.  **Pest Management in Storage:**
    *   **Insect Pests:**
        *   Mix dried neem leaves or neem oil with grains for small-scale storage.
        *   For larger quantities, use approved fumigants like **Aluminium phosphide** tablets (1-2 tablets of 3g per tonne of grain) under airtight conditions for 5-7 days. **Note:** Fumigation with **Aluminium phosphide** is highly toxic and must be carried out by trained personnel following strict safety protocols.
        *   Alternatively, use contact insecticides like **Deltamethrin** dust (0.05%) or **Malathion** dust (5%) mixed with grains at recommended rates for protection against storage pests.
    *   **Rodents:** Implement rodent control measures such as traps and baiting with rodenticides like **Zinc phosphide** or **Bromadiolone** in and around storage structures.
4.  **Aeration:**
    *   Ensure adequate ventilation in storage structures to prevent moisture accumulation and hot spots, which can lead to fungal growth.
5.  **Regular Inspection:**
    *   Periodically inspect stored grains for signs of insect infestation, fungal growth, or moisture build-up. Take immediate corrective action if any issues are detected.
6.  **Bagging and Stacking:**
    *   Store grains in clean, dry, and strong bags. Stack bags on wooden pallets away from walls to allow air circulation and prevent moisture absorption from the floor and walls.

By diligently following these scientifically verified practices, farmers in Haryana can significantly improve wheat yield, grain quality, and ensure longer, safer storage.
