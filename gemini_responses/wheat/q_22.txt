As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Wheat in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Line Sowing:** This is the most recommended method for optimal plant stand, uniform nutrient uptake, and efficient weed and pest management. It can be done using a tractor-drawn seed drill.
    *   **Zero-Till Drill (ZTD):** Highly encouraged, especially in rice-wheat cropping systems, to conserve soil moisture, reduce cultivation costs, and manage crop residues. This method involves direct drilling of wheat seeds into unploughed fields.
    *   **Happy Seeder:** Another excellent option for direct sowing into fields with standing stubble, particularly after rice harvest, promoting residue management and soil health.
    *   **Pattern:** Row sowing is standard.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   A uniform planting depth of **4-6 cm** is crucial for good germination and strong seedling establishment. Too shallow can lead to poor root development and susceptibility to drought, while too deep can result in delayed or poor emergence.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** Maintain a distance of **20-22.5 cm** (8-9 inches) between rows. This allows for adequate light penetration, air circulation, and efficient inter-cultivation operations.

*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   **Timely Sown Wheat (mid-October to mid-November):**
        *   **100 kg per acre** for most recommended varieties.
    *   **Late Sown Wheat (after mid-November):**
        *   Increase the seed rate by 25%, i.e., **125 kg per acre**, to compensate for reduced tillering and shorter growing period.
    *   **Zero-Till/Happy Seeder:**
        *   Generally, **100 kg per acre** is sufficient, but ensure proper calibration of the drill for uniform seed distribution.
    *   **Factors influencing seed dose:** Always consider the germination percentage of the seed lot and the 1000-grain weight of the specific variety. Adjust slightly if germination is low or seed size is exceptionally large.
