As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Wheat in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in wheat relies on an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining resistant varieties, cultural practices, and judicious use of fungicides.

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases in Wheat:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Always choose wheat varieties recommended by HAU that are resistant or tolerant to prevalent diseases in your region.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous wheat cultivation; rotate with non-host crops.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Apply fertilizers as per soil test recommendations. Excessive nitrogen can increase susceptibility to some diseases like powdery mildew.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid conditions favorable for disease development.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues that can harbor pathogens.
3.  **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with recommended fungicides to protect against seed-borne and early-season soil-borne diseases. For example, for loose smut and flag smut, seed treatment with **Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS** at 2.5 g/kg seed is recommended.

Here's how to control the specific fungal conditions you mentioned, along with clarification on their relevance to Wheat:

1.  **Alternaria Leaf Blight (*Alternaria triticina*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Irregular, dark brown spots with concentric rings, primarily on older leaves, which can coalesce to form blighted areas.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   If disease incidence is high, especially under warm and humid conditions, foliar spray can be applied:
            *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 800-1000 g/acre.
            *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 500 ml/acre.

2.  **Anthracnose**
    *   This is not known to affect Wheat significantly. Anthracnose is primarily a disease of maize, sorghum, and some legumes.

3.  **Wheat Blast (*Magnaporthe oryzae* pathotype *Triticum*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** Bleached spikelets, lesions on leaves, nodes, and glumes, leading to partial or complete sterility of the ear. This is an emerging threat.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Use resistant/tolerant varieties.
        *   Avoid late sowing, as it increases susceptibility.
        *   Foliar spray at ear emergence (booting to heading stage) and a second spray 7-10 days later if conditions are favorable for disease development:
            *   **Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG** at 120-160 g/acre.
            *   **Pyraclostrobin 13.3% + Metiram 55% WG** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre.
            *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 200 ml/acre.

4.  **Blight (Foliar Blight Complex - Spot Blotch, Tan Spot) & Brown Spot**
    *   "Blight" is a general term. In wheat, the most common blights are part of the Foliar Blight Complex, including Spot Blotch (*Bipolaris sorokiniana*) and Tan Spot (*Pyrenophora tritici-repentis*). "Brown spot" is often synonymous with Spot Blotch.
    *   **Symptoms:** Brown, oval to irregular spots on leaves, which enlarge and coalesce, leading to premature drying and blighting of foliage.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Practice crop rotation and manage crop residues.
        *   Ensure balanced nutrition.
        *   If disease appears, especially from tillering to flag leaf stage, apply foliar fungicides:
            *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 500 ml/acre.
            *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 250-300 ml/acre.
            *   **Azoxystrobin 23% SC** at 200 ml/acre.
            *   **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 800-1000 g/acre.

5.  **Downy Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Wheat. Downy mildew is common in crops like maize, sorghum, and pearl millet.

6.  **Powdery Mildew (*Blumeria graminis* f. sp. *tritici*)**
    *   **Symptoms:** White, powdery patches on the upper surface of leaves, stems, and sometimes heads. These patches gradually turn greyish-brown.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   Use resistant varieties.
        *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote disease.
        *   If symptoms appear, especially during cool, humid weather, apply foliar fungicides:
            *   **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 500 ml/acre.
            *   **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 250-300 ml/acre.
            *   **Difenoconazole 25% EC** at 100-150 ml/acre.
            *   **Sulphur 80% WP** at 1.0-1.25 kg/acre (effective for early stages or as a preventive).

7.  **Grey Mildew**
    *   This is not known to affect Wheat. This term is not a standard disease name for wheat.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label for safe handling, application, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens.
*   For the most current and localized recommendations, always consult your nearest HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
