As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling rust diseases in Wheat in Haryana.

Rust diseases are among the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide, including Haryana. They can cause significant yield losses if not managed effectively.

Let's address each rust type mentioned:

### Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust)

These three are the major rust diseases affecting Wheat in Haryana. They are caused by different species of fungi but often require similar management strategies.

*   **Black Rust (Stem Rust):** Caused by *Puccinia graminis tritici*. Primarily affects stems and leaf sheaths.
*   **Brown Rust (Leaf Rust):** Caused by *Puccinia triticina*. Primarily affects leaves.
*   **Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust):** Caused by *Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici*. Appears as yellow stripes on leaves.

**Control Measures for Black, Brown, and Yellow Rusts in Wheat:**

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Preventive):**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** The most effective and economical method is to cultivate rust-resistant wheat varieties recommended for Haryana. HAU regularly releases new varieties with improved resistance.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to the recommended sowing dates for your region. Early or late sowing can sometimes increase susceptibility.
3.  **Balanced Fertilization:** Avoid excessive nitrogen application, as it can make the crop more succulent and susceptible to rusts. Ensure balanced application of NPK as per soil test recommendations.
4.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove volunteer wheat plants and alternate hosts (e.g., Barberry for Black Rust, though less common in Haryana's wheat belt) from around the fields.
5.  **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation to break the disease cycle, although rust spores are wind-borne and can travel long distances.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicides are effective when applied at the appearance of initial symptoms or as a prophylactic measure in areas with a history of severe rust outbreaks.

*   **Timing:** The first spray should be given immediately upon the appearance of initial rust pustules. A second spray may be required 15-20 days later if the disease persists or weather conditions remain favorable for its development.
*   **Application:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage. Use a high-volume sprayer with adequate water (e.g., 200 litres of water per acre).

CIBRC approved technical chemical names for rust control in Wheat include:

*   **Propiconazole** 25% EC: Apply 200 ml per acre.
*   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: Apply 250-300 ml per acre.
*   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Apply 200 ml per acre.
*   **Difenoconazole** 25% EC: Apply 100 ml per acre.
*   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG: Apply 150-200 g per acre.

### White Rust

This is not known to affect Wheat. White rust (caused by *Albugo candida*) primarily affects cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and other members of the Brassicaceae family.

### Red Rust

This is not a standard distinct rust disease known to affect Wheat. The primary rust diseases affecting Wheat are Black Rust (Stem Rust), Brown Rust (Leaf Rust), and Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust). The term "Red Rust" is sometimes used colloquially, often referring to Brown Rust due to its reddish-brown spore colour. Therefore, the control measures for Brown Rust would apply if this term is used in that context.
