As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must provide scientifically verified advice. Let's address each component of your query regarding physical damage in Wheat:

1.  **Fruit bursting in Wheat:**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. Wheat produces grains (caryopses), not fleshy fruits that are susceptible to bursting. This phenomenon is typically observed in horticultural crops like tomatoes or pomegranates due to rapid water uptake or specific nutrient imbalances.

2.  **Leaf burning/melting in Wheat:**
    *   **Leaf burning (Scorching/Necrosis):** This is a common issue in wheat and can be caused by various factors, primarily abiotic stresses.
        *   **Causes:**
            *   **Heat Stress:** High temperatures, especially during the grain filling stage, can cause leaf scorching.
            *   **Drought Stress:** Insufficient soil moisture leads to desiccation and burning of leaf margins.
            *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Deficiencies of essential nutrients like Potassium (K) often manifest as marginal leaf scorching. Magnesium (Mg) deficiency can also lead to interveinal chlorosis followed by necrosis.
            *   **Herbicide Phytotoxicity:** Incorrect dosage, improper application, or drift of herbicides can cause chemical burn on leaves.
            *   **Salinity/Sodicity:** High salt concentration in soil or irrigation water can lead to leaf tip and marginal burn.
            *   **Excessive Fertilizer Application:** Over-application of certain fertilizers, especially nitrogen, can cause salt burn.
        *   **Control Measures:**
            *   **Agronomic Practices:**
                *   **Timely Sowing:** Sow wheat varieties at the recommended time to avoid peak heat stress during critical growth stages.
                *   **Irrigation Management:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation, especially at critical stages like Crown Root Initiation (CRI), tillering, flowering, and grain filling. Avoid water stress.
                *   **Residue Management:** Retaining crop residues can help moderate soil temperature and conserve moisture.
            *   **Nutrient Management:**
                *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct regular soil tests to determine nutrient status and apply fertilizers based on recommendations.
                *   **Potassium Deficiency:** If soil test indicates low K, apply **Potassium chloride** (Muriate of Potash) at 40-60 kg/acre as basal or top dressing.
                *   **Magnesium Deficiency:** For visible symptoms, apply foliar spray of **Magnesium sulphate** at 0.5-1.0% concentration (5-10 g/L of water) during early morning or late evening.
            *   **Herbicide Application:** Always use recommended herbicides at the correct dosage and application method. Avoid spraying during windy conditions to prevent drift.
            *   **Salinity/Sodicity Management:** For saline/sodic soils, incorporate soil amendments like gypsum as per soil test recommendations and ensure proper drainage.
    *   **Leaf melting:** This term is not a standard description for physical damage in wheat leaves. Severe tissue collapse or rot is usually associated with specific diseases (fungal/bacterial) or extreme environmental conditions leading to complete tissue degradation, rather than a general "melting" as a physical damage.

3.  **Hardness in fruit in Wheat:**
    This is not known to affect Wheat as a 'damage'. Wheat produces grains, and grain hardness is a desirable quality characteristic, not a defect. Wheat varieties are classified as hard, medium hard, or soft based on their endosperm texture, which is a genetic trait influencing milling and end-use quality (e.g., hard wheat for bread, soft wheat for biscuits). If you are referring to poor grain filling leading to shriveled or undesirable texture, this is typically due to severe environmental stresses (e.g., heat stress, drought) during the grain development period, or nutrient deficiencies, which impair the proper accumulation of starch and protein in the grain. The control measures for such issues would align with those for managing heat and drought stress, and ensuring balanced nutrition as mentioned under "Leaf burning."
