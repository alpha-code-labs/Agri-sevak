As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Wheat in Haryana.

It's important to first clarify which of these pests are significant threats to wheat in our region:

1.  **Aphids (e.g., Bird cherry-oat aphid, English grain aphid):** These are major sucking pests of wheat in Haryana, causing direct damage by feeding and indirect damage by transmitting viral diseases.
2.  **Leafhoppers:** While various leafhopper species exist, they are generally not considered a major economic pest of wheat in Haryana, unlike aphids. Their presence is usually low and does not warrant specific control measures unless populations are exceptionally high.
3.  **Whitefly:** This is not known to affect Wheat as a significant economic pest requiring control measures in Haryana. Whiteflies are primarily pests of cotton, vegetables, and other broadleaf crops.
4.  **Thrips (e.g., Wheat thrips):** Thrips can occasionally be a pest, particularly affecting florets and developing grains, but are generally less problematic than aphids on wheat foliage in Haryana.
5.  **Psylla:** This is not known to affect Wheat. Psylla species are typically pests of specific tree crops (e.g., citrus, mango).

Therefore, our primary focus for sucking pest control in wheat will be on **Aphids**, with general IPM principles also covering minor occurrences of leafhoppers and thrips.

### **Control of Aphids (and general management for minor Leafhopper/Thrips infestations) in Wheat**

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for your region, choose wheat varieties known to have some level of resistance or tolerance to aphid infestations. Consult HAU recommendations for the latest varieties.
2.  **Timely Sowing:** Sowing wheat at the recommended time for your region can help plants establish well and potentially escape peak aphid populations.
3.  **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush growth that is more attractive to aphids and can increase their multiplication rate. Follow recommended fertilizer doses based on soil testing.
4.  **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation to maintain plant vigor, which can help plants tolerate some pest pressure.
5.  **Conservation of Natural Enemies:**
    *   Avoid indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum insecticides, which can harm beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphidius* species). These natural enemies play a crucial role in keeping aphid populations in check.
    *   Provide refuge for natural enemies by maintaining diverse vegetation around fields where feasible.
6.  **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly scout your wheat fields, especially from the tillering stage to the milky grain stage, to detect aphid infestations early. Look for colonies on leaves, stems, and earheads. Economic Threshold Level (ETL) for aphids in wheat is generally considered to be 5-10 aphids per earhead or 20-30 aphids per tiller.

**II. Chemical Control (if IPM measures are insufficient and ETL is crossed):**

When aphid populations exceed the Economic Threshold Level (ETL) and natural enemies are not effectively controlling them, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always use CIBRC approved chemicals and follow label instructions carefully.

**Recommended Insecticides for Aphid Control in Wheat:**

*   **For foliar spray:**
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 100-125 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 50 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 80-100 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** 60 g per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water).
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 320 ml per acre (effective against nymphs, less so for adults).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** 100 ml per acre (diluted in 200-300 litres of water). *Use with caution as it can be harmful to beneficial insects.*

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when aphid populations are building up but before they cause significant damage or migrate to earheads. Early morning or late evening sprays are preferable to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and within the plant canopy, where aphids often hide.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow pre-harvest interval (PHI) guidelines mentioned on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in aphid populations.
