Both Red spider mite (e.g., *Tetranychus urticae*) and Wheat rust mite (*Aceria tosichella*) are known to affect wheat in Haryana, particularly under dry and warm conditions. The wheat rust mite is also a significant vector for viral diseases like Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV).

Here's how to control them:

**I. General Management Practices (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

1.  **Scouting:** Regularly monitor wheat fields, especially during dry spells, for the presence of mites. Red spider mites are visible as tiny red or greenish dots, often with webbing on the underside of leaves. Wheat rust mites are microscopic and cause symptoms like leaf rolling, silvering, or purpling, often starting from the leaf margins.
2.  **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture through timely irrigation. Mites thrive in hot and dry conditions.
3.  **Weed Management:** Remove weeds from and around the wheat fields, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
4.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for the region, consider using wheat varieties known to have some level of resistance or tolerance to mite damage or mite-transmitted viruses.

**II. Chemical Control (Acaricides):**

If mite infestation is severe and causing significant damage, chemical intervention may be necessary. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves where mites reside. For wheat rust mites, achieving effective control with chemicals can be challenging due to their protected location within leaf folds.

The following CIBRC approved technical chemical names can be used:

*   **Propargite** 57% EC: Apply at a rate of 1.0 - 1.25 Litres per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.
*   **Fenpyroximate** 5% EC: Apply at a rate of 200-300 ml per acre, mixed in 200-400 Litres of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for the chosen acaricide, including dosage, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate acaricides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in mite populations.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension specialists for the most current and specific recommendations for your area.
