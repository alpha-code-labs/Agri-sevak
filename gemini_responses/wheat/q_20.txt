Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the critical importance of micronutrients for optimal wheat yield and quality. Addressing these deficiencies requires a scientific and systematic approach.

**General Approach to Micronutrient Management in Wheat:**

1.  **Soil Testing is Paramount:** Before applying any micronutrient, it is crucial to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This is the most reliable method to identify specific deficiencies and their severity in your field. HAU recommends regular soil testing every 2-3 years.
2.  **Integrated Nutrient Management:** Micronutrient application should be part of an integrated nutrient management strategy, considering macro-nutrient status and soil properties (pH, organic matter).
3.  **Application Methods:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Suitable for prophylactic measures or severe deficiencies, often applied at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application:** Highly effective for quick correction of observed deficiencies during crop growth, as nutrients are directly absorbed by leaves.

Here's how to address specific micronutrient deficiencies in Wheat:

---

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

Zinc deficiency is one of the most widespread micronutrient problems in wheat in Haryana, especially in high pH and calcareous soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing of younger leaves (chlorosis), often developing reddish-brown spots or streaks on older leaves.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 25 kg/acre, or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 10 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (When Symptoms Appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5% solution of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5 g/L of water) or 0.1% solution of **Zinc EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays, starting at the tillering stage and subsequent sprays at 10-15 day intervals, or as per symptom persistence.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

Iron deficiency is common in wheat grown on high pH, calcareous, or waterlogged soils in Haryana.

*   **Symptoms:** Prominent interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) of younger leaves, while veins remain green. In severe cases, entire leaves may turn white.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Generally not recommended for iron due to rapid fixation in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (When Symptoms Appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Alternatively, use 0.1% solution of **Ferrous EDTA** (1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting immediately when symptoms are observed. Ensure good coverage of foliage.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

Boron deficiency can occur in wheat, particularly in sandy soils with low organic matter or under drought conditions.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, poor pollen viability leading to reduced grain set, deformed or shrivelled grains, and necrosis of young leaves or growing points.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic, based on soil test):**
        *   Apply **Borax** (10.5% B) at 2-4 kg/acre, or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20.5% B) at 0.5-1 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated before sowing. *Caution: Boron has a narrow margin between deficiency and toxicity; precise application based on soil test is critical.*
    *   **Foliar Application (When Symptoms Appear or at critical stages):**
        *   Spray 0.1-0.2% solution of **Borax** (1-2 g/L of water) or 0.05-0.1% solution of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (0.5-1 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at tillering or pre-flowering stages to support reproductive development.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

Calcium deficiency in wheat is relatively rare in typical Haryana soils, which are often calcareous. It might occur in highly acidic or extremely sandy soils.

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, necrosis of young leaves and growing points, poor root development, and weak stems.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   For sodic soils (common in Haryana), application of **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate) at recommended rates for reclamation will also supply calcium.
        *   For acidic soils (less common in Haryana), application of **Calcium Carbonate** (lime) can correct both acidity and calcium deficiency.
    *   **Foliar Application (If symptoms are observed):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Calcium Chloride** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply at tillering or booting stage.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

Magnesium deficiency can occur in wheat, especially in sandy soils, or where potassium is applied excessively, leading to antagonism.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, sometimes with a purplish tinge.
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application (Prophylactic/Severe Deficiency):**
        *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre at the time of sowing.
    *   **Foliar Application (When Symptoms Appear):**
        *   Spray 1.0-2.0% solution of **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (10-20 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 1-2 sprays at 10-15 day intervals when symptoms are observed.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

Manganese deficiency in wheat is observed in some areas of Haryana, particularly in high pH soils with high organic matter content or poorly drained conditions.

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis of younger leaves, often with greyish-brown spots or streaks, especially at the base of the leaf blade (known as "grey speck" disease).
*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Generally less effective due to rapid oxidation and fixation in high pH soils.
    *   **Foliar Application (When Symptoms Appear):**
        *   Spray 0.5-1.0% solution of **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (5-10 g/L of water).
        *   Apply 2-3 sprays at 7-10 day intervals, starting at the tillering stage, or when symptoms are first noticed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always use clean water for spraying.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage during foliar application.
*   Avoid spraying during hot midday hours or when rain is expected.
*   Consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or HAU extension specialist for specific recommendations tailored to your field's soil test report and local conditions.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage micronutrient deficiencies in your wheat crop and achieve higher yields and better quality.
