Wheat is primarily a direct-seeded crop and is generally **not transplanted**.

Therefore, there is no ideal transplantation time, distance, or process for wheat as it is not a common or recommended practice for this crop.

Wheat is typically sown directly into the field using methods such as drilling or broadcasting. The ideal sowing time, depth, and spacing for direct seeding are crucial for optimal yield.

**Typical Sowing Information for Wheat (Direct Seeding):**

*   **Sowing Time:** Mid-October to Mid-November (optimal for most varieties in Haryana). Late sowing can lead to significant yield reduction.
*   **Sowing Depth:** 4-6 cm.
*   **Row to Row Distance:** 20-22.5 cm (for drilled sowing).
*   **Seed Rate:** 100 kg/acre for timely sown conditions. For late sown conditions, it may increase to 125 kg/acre.
