As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that most of the practices you've listed are not applicable to wheat cultivation. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an annual cereal crop with a distinct growth habit that does not require or benefit from these specialized horticultural techniques.

Here's a breakdown for each practice:

*   **Pruning:**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. Pruning involves the removal of plant parts to shape growth or improve yield, typically in woody plants or some vegetables. Wheat is an annual cereal crop where all tillers and leaves contribute to photosynthesis and grain filling. Removing any part would likely reduce, not enhance, yield.

*   **Desuckering:**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. Desuckering is the removal of basal shoots (suckers) to direct energy to the main stem or fruit, common in crops like sugarcane or banana. Wheat produces tillers, which are analogous to suckers, but these are crucial for yield formation and are highly desirable. Removing them would be detrimental.

*   **Mulching:**
    Mulching is a beneficial practice in wheat cultivation, particularly in the context of conservation agriculture and moisture management in Haryana. While not a "specialized" practice in the same way as pruning or grafting, it is an important cultural practice.
    *   **Benefits for Wheat:**
        *   **Moisture Conservation:** A layer of mulch (e.g., crop residues from previous paddy crop in a rice-wheat system) reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving precious soil moisture, which is critical for rainfed wheat or during dry spells in irrigated areas.
        *   **Weed Suppression:** Mulch can physically suppress weed germination and growth, reducing competition for nutrients and water.
        *   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** It helps moderate soil temperature, protecting roots from extreme heat or cold.
        *   **Soil Health Improvement:** Over time, organic mulches decompose, adding organic matter to the soil, improving soil structure, and enhancing microbial activity.
    *   **Common Mulch Material:** In Haryana, paddy straw (after combine harvesting) is commonly used as mulch in zero-tillage wheat systems.

*   **Grafting:**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. Grafting is a horticultural technique used to join parts of two plants, typically woody species or some vegetables, to grow as one. Wheat is a monocotyledonous annual cereal crop with a simple stem structure that is not amenable to grafting, nor is there any biological reason or benefit to attempt it.

*   **Pollination:**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. Wheat is predominantly a self-pollinating crop. Its flowers are cleistogamous, meaning they typically pollinate themselves before the flower opens (or sometimes without opening at all). While some minor cross-pollination can occur via wind, specialized practices like hand pollination or introducing insect pollinators are entirely unnecessary and not performed in wheat cultivation. The crop efficiently ensures its own seed set.
