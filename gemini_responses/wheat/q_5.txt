As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice regarding the control of diseases and conditions in Wheat, specifically for the Haryana region.

Let's address each condition you've mentioned:

### Scab (Fusarium Head Blight - FHB) in Wheat

Scab, also known as Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), is a significant fungal disease that affects wheat, particularly during warm, humid conditions at flowering. It can cause premature bleaching of spikelets, shriveled grains, and reduced yield and quality.

**Integrated Management for Scab (FHB):**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Choose wheat varieties known to have resistance or tolerance to FHB. HAU continuously evaluates and recommends such varieties suitable for Haryana.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous wheat cultivation, especially after maize or rice, as these crops can also host the Fusarium pathogen. Rotate with non-host crops like mustard, gram, or cotton.
    *   **Residue Management:** Plough in or remove infected crop residues from the previous season, as the fungus can survive on these residues and serve as a source of inoculum.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure balanced fertilizer application. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes increase susceptibility.
    *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid the most susceptible growth stages coinciding with peak disease-favorable weather.

2.  **Chemical Control (Fungicides):**
    *   Fungicide application is most effective when applied at the beginning of flowering (anthesis) or shortly after, when the anthers are visible. Good coverage of the wheat heads is crucial.
    *   **Recommended Fungicides:**
        *   **Tebuconazole** (25.9% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of 625 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.
        *   **Propiconazole** (25% EC formulation): Apply at a rate of 500 ml per acre in 200-300 litres of water.

### Canker

This is not known to affect Wheat. Canker diseases are primarily associated with woody plants (trees and shrubs) or some fruit crops, causing localized lesions on stems, branches, or trunks.

### Gummosis

This is not known to affect Wheat. Gummosis is the pathological production and exudation of gum from the bark of trees, typically fruit trees (e.g., citrus, stone fruits) in response to stress, injury, or disease. Wheat plants do not exhibit gummosis.

### Lichen

This is not known to affect Wheat. Lichens are symbiotic organisms (fungus and alga) that grow on surfaces like rocks, tree bark, or soil. They are non-parasitic and do not cause disease or damage to living wheat plants. They might be observed on dead stubble or non-living surfaces but do not affect the crop itself.
