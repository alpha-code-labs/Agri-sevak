As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must emphasize that there are no direct chemical treatments (viricides) available to cure viral diseases in plants once they are infected. Control strategies primarily focus on prevention, managing the vectors (insects or mites) that transmit the viruses, and using resistant varieties.

Here's how to control the mentioned conditions in Wheat:

1.  **Leaf curl (Wheat Leaf Curl Virus - WLCV):**
    *   This affects Wheat.
    *   **Symptoms:** Infected plants show stunting, leaf curling, and yellowing, leading to significant yield losses. It is primarily transmitted by aphids.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant wheat varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to WLCV.
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Adhere to recommended sowing dates to avoid peak vector populations.
        *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around wheat fields, as they can serve as alternate hosts for both the virus and its aphid vectors.
        *   **Vector Control (Aphids):**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with systemic insecticides to protect young seedlings from aphid infestation.
                *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 4.5-6.0 ml/kg seed.
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 30 FS at 10 ml/kg seed.
            *   **Foliar Spray:** If aphid populations are high during the growing season, apply foliar insecticides.
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 125 ml/acre.
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG at 50 g/acre.

2.  **Mosaic (Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus - WSMV, Soil-borne Wheat Mosaic Virus - SBWMV, Wheat Yellow Mosaic Virus - WYMV):**
    *   This affects Wheat.
    *   **Symptoms:** These viruses cause yellow streaking, mottling, or mosaic patterns on leaves, stunting, and reduced tillering. WSMV is transmitted by the wheat curl mite, while SBWMV and WYMV are soil-borne and transmitted by the fungus *Polymyxa graminis*.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Utilize wheat varieties with known resistance to these mosaic viruses.
        *   **Destroy Volunteer Plants:** Eliminate volunteer wheat plants and grassy weeds before sowing, as they can harbor viruses and vectors.
        *   **Crop Rotation:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to reduce soil-borne inoculum.
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Avoid early sowing, which can expose plants to higher mite populations.
        *   **Vector Control (for WSMV - Wheat Curl Mite):**
            *   **Foliar Spray:** If wheat curl mite populations are detected, apply acaricides.
                *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9 SC at 160 ml/acre.
                *   **Propargite** 57 EC at 500 ml/acre.

3.  **Yellow vein clearing:**
    *   This is not known to affect Wheat as a distinct viral disease. Yellowing symptoms can occur with various wheat diseases, but "yellow vein clearing" as a specific viral disease name is not associated with wheat.

4.  **Stripe:**
    *   This affects Wheat as a symptom of various viral diseases, particularly Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) and Wheat Yellow Mosaic Virus (WYMV).
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellow streaks or stripes on leaves, often accompanied by stunting and reduced vigor.
    *   **Control Measures:** As these symptoms are caused by the mosaic viruses mentioned above, the control measures are identical to those for "Mosaic" diseases. Please refer to the control strategies listed under "Mosaic" above.

5.  **Tristeza:**
    *   This is not known to affect Wheat. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is a major disease of citrus crops.

6.  **Stunt virus (Wheat Dwarf Virus - WDV, Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus - BYDV):**
    *   This affects Wheat.
    *   **Symptoms:** Infected plants exhibit severe stunting, yellowing or reddening of leaves, and reduced grain yield. WDV is transmitted by leafhoppers, while BYDV is transmitted by aphids.
    *   **Control Measures:**
        *   **Resistant Varieties:** Plant wheat varieties with resistance or tolerance to WDV and BYDV.
        *   **Timely Sowing:** Adjust sowing dates to avoid periods of high vector activity.
        *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds that can host the viruses and their vectors.
        *   **Vector Control (Leafhoppers/Aphids):**
            *   **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with systemic insecticides to protect young seedlings.
                *   **Imidacloprid** 600 FS at 4.5-6.0 ml/kg seed.
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 30 FS at 10 ml/kg seed.
            *   **Foliar Spray:** If vector populations are high during the growing season, apply foliar insecticides.
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8 SL at 125 ml/acre.
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25 WG at 50 g/acre.

**General Recommendation:**
An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining resistant varieties, cultural practices, and judicious use of CIBRC-approved insecticides/acaricides for vector control, is crucial for managing viral diseases in wheat. Always consult with local agricultural extension services for the most current recommendations specific to your region and crop conditions.
