As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing growth issues in Wheat in Haryana:

### Management of Growth Issues in Wheat

**1. Slow Growth**

Slow growth in wheat can be attributed to various factors, including nutrient deficiencies, water stress, soil compaction, or early pest/disease incidence.

*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Conduct a soil test to identify specific nutrient deficiencies.
    *   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** If identified, apply **Urea** as a top dressing at appropriate growth stages (e.g., tillering, jointing).
    *   **Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) Deficiency:** Ensure adequate basal application of **Di-ammonium phosphate** (DAP) and **Muriate of Potash** (MOP) as per soil test recommendations.
    *   **Zinc (Zn) Deficiency:** Apply **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** (21%) at 25 kg/acre as a basal application or foliar spray of 0.5% solution (500 g **Zinc sulfate heptahydrate** in 100 L water) at tillering and flag leaf stages.
    *   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Chlorosis):** Foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% **Ferrous sulfate** solution (500 g - 1 kg **Ferrous sulfate** in 100 L water) at weekly intervals until recovery.
    *   **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:** Foliar spray of 0.5% **Manganese sulfate** solution (500 g **Manganese sulfate** in 100 L water) at tillering and jointing stages.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially at critical growth stages (crown root initiation, tillering, jointing, flowering, grain filling).
*   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure through proper tillage and incorporation of organic matter.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Identify and manage any specific pests or diseases that might be hindering growth.

**2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)**

Yellowing of wheat leaves is often a symptom of nutrient deficiency, waterlogging, or cold stress.

*   **Nitrogen (N) Deficiency:** The most common cause. Apply **Urea** as a top dressing at 30-40 kg/acre, depending on the severity and previous application.
*   **Iron (Fe) Deficiency (Interveinal Chlorosis):** Foliar spray of 0.5-1.0% **Ferrous sulfate** solution (500 g - 1 kg **Ferrous sulfate** in 100 L water) at weekly intervals until recovery.
*   **Sulfur (S) Deficiency:** Apply **Gypsum** at 100 kg/acre or **Elemental sulfur** at 10-15 kg/acre as a basal application or top dressing.
*   **Manganese (Mn) Deficiency:** Foliar spray of 0.5% **Manganese sulfate** solution (500 g **Manganese sulfate** in 100 L water) at tillering and jointing stages.
*   **Waterlogging:** Improve field drainage to prevent water stagnation.
*   **Cold Stress:** While direct chemical management is limited, ensuring optimal nutrient status helps plants withstand stress.

**3. Excessive Height (Lodging Risk)**

Excessive height can lead to lodging (falling over of plants), causing significant yield losses.

*   **Variety Selection:** Choose lodging-resistant wheat varieties suitable for Haryana.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive application of Nitrogen, especially in late stages, as it promotes vegetative growth and height.
*   **Planting Density:** Maintain optimal plant spacing to prevent overcrowding.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** These can be used to reduce stem elongation and strengthen stems, thereby reducing lodging risk.
    *   Apply **Chlormequat chloride** at 1000-1250 ml/acre (50% SL formulation) or **Ethephon** at 250-300 ml/acre (39% SL formulation) or **Trinexapac-ethyl** at 125-150 ml/acre (25% EC formulation) at the tillering to jointing stage (Zadoks scale 25-32), as per product label instructions and local recommendations. Ensure proper timing and application rate for efficacy and safety.

**4. Excessive Flowering**

This is not known to affect Wheat as a negative growth issue requiring management. Wheat is cultivated for its grains, which are the product of successful flowering. "Excessive flowering" is generally indicative of good reproductive development. If the concern is premature flowering, it would be addressed through variety selection and managing environmental stresses like heat.
