Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding "drying up" in wheat. It is important to clarify that wheat, being a monocotyledonous plant, does not have "branches" in the conventional sense. The drying symptoms would typically refer to leaves, tillers, stems, and eventually the ear (containing grains, which are the "fruits" of wheat).

"Drying up" is a general symptom, not a specific disease or pest. It indicates severe stress to the plant, which can be caused by a multitude of factors, both abiotic (environmental) and biotic (diseases, pests). Therefore, accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is crucial before implementing any management strategy.

Here's how to address "drying up" in wheat, based on potential causes:

### **I. Abiotic Factors (Non-Biological Causes)**

These are the most common reasons for widespread drying symptoms in wheat fields.

1.  **Water Stress (Drought):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves roll, turn yellow, and dry from the tip downwards. Entire plants may wilt and dry prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages (crown root initiation, tillering, jointing, flowering, and grain filling).
        *   Use water-efficient irrigation methods like sprinkler or drip irrigation where feasible.
        *   Incorporate organic matter into the soil to improve water retention capacity.

2.  **Heat Stress:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Premature senescence (drying) of leaves, shriveling of grains, and reduced grain filling, especially if high temperatures occur during the grain-filling stage.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Sow heat-tolerant wheat varieties.
        *   Ensure timely sowing to avoid the peak heat period during critical growth stages.
        *   Provide light irrigation during periods of high temperature to mitigate stress.

3.  **Nutrient Deficiencies:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Specific nutrient deficiencies can cause yellowing, necrosis, and drying of leaves. For example, severe potassium deficiency can cause scorching and drying of leaf margins.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct regular soil testing to determine nutrient status.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   For specific deficiencies, foliar application of micronutrients may provide quick relief.

4.  **Salinity/Sodicity:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, bluish-green leaves, burning/drying of leaf tips and margins, reduced tillering, and poor grain filling.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Apply soil amendments like **Gypsum** (Calcium sulfate) for sodic soils.
        *   Ensure proper drainage to leach out excess salts.
        *   Use salt-tolerant wheat varieties.
        *   Irrigate with good quality water.

5.  **Waterlogging:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing of lower leaves, wilting, and eventual drying of plants due to root damage from lack of oxygen.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Ensure proper field drainage to prevent water accumulation.
        *   Avoid irrigation immediately after heavy rainfall.
        *   Improve soil structure through organic matter addition.

6.  **Frost Damage:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves and young tillers may appear water-soaked, turn whitish or brownish, and then dry up.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Sow frost-tolerant varieties.
        *   Provide light irrigation during anticipated frost periods to raise soil temperature.
        *   Avoid late sowing which exposes young plants to severe winter frost.

### **II. Biotic Factors (Biological Causes - Diseases and Pests)**

These factors directly attack the plant, leading to wilting and drying.

1.  **Root Rot and Crown Rot Diseases:**
    *   **Causative Agents:** Fungi like *Fusarium culmorum*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Bipolaris sorokiniana* (part of the spot blotch complex). These pathogens infect roots and the crown region, impairing water and nutrient uptake.
    *   **Symptoms:** Yellowing, wilting, and premature drying of individual tillers or entire plants, often in patches. Roots may appear discolored and rotted.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Crop rotation, proper field sanitation, balanced nutrition.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment - most effective preventive):**
            *   **Carboxin** 37.5% + **Thiram** 37.5% WS @ 2.5 g/kg seed
            *   **Tebuconazole** 2% DS @ 2.5 g/kg seed
            *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP @ 2 g/kg seed

2.  **Spot Blotch / Leaf Blight:**
    *   **Causative Agent:** *Bipolaris sorokiniana*.
    *   **Symptoms:** Oval to elongated dark brown lesions on leaves that coalesce, leading to large areas of dead tissue and premature drying of leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties, crop rotation, residue management.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 200 ml/acre
            *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG @ 250 g/acre
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200 ml/acre

3.  **Rust Diseases (Leaf, Stem, Stripe Rust):**
    *   **Causative Agents:** *Puccinia triticina* (leaf rust), *Puccinia graminis tritici* (stem rust), *Puccinia striiformis* (stripe rust).
    *   **Symptoms:** While primary symptoms are pustules, severe infections can lead to extensive damage, premature yellowing, and drying of leaves, significantly reducing photosynthetic area.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties, timely sowing.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray at first appearance of pustules):**
            *   **Propiconazole** 25% EC @ 200 ml/acre
            *   **Tebuconazole** 25% WG @ 250 g/acre
            *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC @ 200 ml/acre

4.  **Nematodes (e.g., Cereal Cyst Nematode - *Heterodera avenae*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing, reduced tillering, and wilting/drying of plants, often in patches. Roots may show characteristic cysts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Use resistant wheat varieties, crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., mustard, chickpea), summer ploughing.
        *   **Chemical (Seed Treatment/Soil Application - use with caution and only if severe infestation is confirmed):**
            *   **Carbofuran** 3% G @ 10 kg/acre (soil application at sowing) - *Note: Use of granular nematicides requires careful handling and adherence to safety guidelines.*

5.  **Insect Pests (e.g., Termites, Aphids, Stem Borers):**
    *   **Termites:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Plants dry up from the base, often in patches, as termites feed on roots and stem base.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Chemical (Soil Application at sowing or drenching):**
                *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 1-2 L/acre (mixed with irrigation water or as drench)
    *   **Aphids:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Severe infestation can cause yellowing, curling, and premature drying of leaves due to sap sucking.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL @ 125 ml/acre
                *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG @ 100 g/acre
    *   **Stem Borers:**
        *   **Symptoms:** Can cause "dead heart" (central shoot dries up) or "white ear" (ear turns white and dries prematurely without grain filling).
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray/Granular application):**
                *   **Fipronil** 0.3% G @ 8-10 kg/acre (broadcast)
                *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC @ 500 ml/acre (foliar spray)

### **General Recommendations:**

*   **Field Inspection:** Regularly scout your fields to identify the specific symptoms and patterns of drying. Note if it's widespread, patchy, or affecting individual plants.
*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM):** Combine cultural practices, resistant varieties, biological control, and judicious use of chemicals for sustainable management.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through balanced fertilization, organic matter addition, and proper tillage practices.
*   **Variety Selection:** Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant, and stress-tolerant wheat varieties suitable for Haryana's agro-climatic conditions.

**Crucial Advice:** Since "drying up" is a symptom, it is highly recommended to consult with HAU experts or your local agricultural extension officer. Bring samples of affected plants for accurate diagnosis, which will lead to the most effective and targeted management strategy.
