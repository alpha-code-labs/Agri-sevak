As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling weeds in wheat in Haryana:

Effective weed management in wheat requires a combination of cultural practices and timely application of appropriate herbicides. The critical period for weed competition in wheat is generally between 30 to 60 days after sowing (DAS). Post-emergence herbicide application around 30-35 DAS, when weeds are in their 2-4 leaf stage, is usually most effective.

### General Weed Control Strategy

1.  **Pre-emergence Application (Optional but beneficial):**
    *   For general suppression of annual grasses and some broadleaf weeds, apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.3 litres per acre within 0-3 days after sowing. Mix with 150-200 litres of water and ensure uniform spray.

2.  **Post-emergence Application (Crucial):**
    *   Apply herbicides when weeds are actively growing and at their susceptible stage (typically 2-4 leaf stage for most weeds), usually around 30-35 DAS, with adequate soil moisture.

### Specific Weed Control Recommendations:

#### 1. Phalaris minor (Gulli Danda) and other Narrow Leaf Weeds (e.g., Wild Oat - Avena ludoviciana)

These are major problematic weeds in wheat. For effective control, use one of the following CIBRC approved post-emergence herbicides:

*   **Clodinafop-propargyl** 15% WP: Apply 160 g per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl** 9.3% EC: Apply 160 ml per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **Pinoxaden** 5.1% EC: Apply 200 ml per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **Sulfosulfuron** 75% WG: Apply 13.5 g per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water. (Note: Sulfosulfuron also provides control of some broadleaf weeds).

**Important:** Rotate herbicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of herbicide resistance in *Phalaris minor*.

#### 2. Broad Leaf Weeds (including Bathu - Chenopodium album)

For control of Bathu and other common broadleaf weeds like *Anagallis arvensis*, *Melilotus indica*, *Fumaria parviflora*, etc., use one of the following CIBRC approved post-emergence herbicides:

*   **Metsulfuron-methyl** 20% WP: Apply 8 g per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **2,4-D sodium salt** 80% WP: Apply 250 g per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water. For severe infestations or slightly older wheat (up to 40-45 DAS), the dose can be increased to 500 g per acre.
*   **2,4-D ethyl ester** 38% EC: Apply 500 ml per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **Carfentrazone-ethyl** 20% EC: Apply 20 g per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.

#### 3. Mixed Weed Flora (Both Narrow Leaf and Broad Leaf Weeds)

When both types of weeds are present, pre-mix formulations are highly effective:

*   **Clodinafop-propargyl 15% + Metsulfuron-methyl 1% WP**: Apply 160 g per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **Pinoxaden 5.1% + Metsulfuron-methyl 0.5% EC**: Apply 200 ml per acre, dissolved in 150 litres of water.
*   **Sulfosulfuron** 75% WG: As mentioned above, this herbicide provides control for both *Phalaris minor* and several broadleaf weeds.

#### 4. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.)

This is not known to affect Wheat as a significant weed. Wheat is generally considered a non-host or a very poor host for common *Cuscuta* species that are problematic in agriculture.

#### 5. Congress Grass (Parthenium hysterophorus)

While *Parthenium hysterophorus* can be found in agricultural landscapes, it is not typically a major weed within a well-established wheat crop. Its primary habitat is disturbed areas, roadsides, and field bunds. If it does appear within the wheat field, it can be effectively controlled by the broadleaf herbicides mentioned above, such as **2,4-D sodium salt** or **Metsulfuron-methyl**. Management efforts are often more focused on controlling it in non-cropped areas to prevent seed dispersal into fields.

#### 6. Orobanche (Orobanche spp.)

This is not known to affect Wheat. *Orobanche* species (Broomrapes) are parasitic weeds that primarily attack dicotyledonous plants (e.g., mustard, tobacco, sunflower), not monocotyledonous crops like wheat.

### General Application Guidelines:

*   **Water Volume:** Always use the recommended water volume (typically 150 litres per acre) for uniform coverage.
*   **Nozzle Type:** Use flat fan nozzles for optimal spray distribution.
*   **Soil Moisture:** Ensure adequate soil moisture at the time of herbicide application for best results.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when rain is expected within 6 hours of application.
*   **Safety:** Always wear protective clothing (gloves, mask, goggles) during mixing and spraying. Read and strictly follow the instructions on the herbicide label.
*   **Resistance Management:** To prevent herbicide resistance, especially for *Phalaris minor*, rotate herbicides with different modes of action and integrate cultural practices like timely sowing, proper fertilizer management, and crop rotation.
