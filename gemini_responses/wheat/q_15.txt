As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Wheat in Haryana:

1.  **Grasshopper (Various species of Acrididae):**
    Grasshoppers can be a significant pest of wheat, especially during early crop stages or in outbreak situations.

    *   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect fields, particularly field margins, for grasshopper nymphs and adults.
    *   **Cultural Control:**
        *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and destroy eggs laid in the soil.
        *   Field sanitation and removal of weeds can reduce breeding sites.
        *   Early sowing of wheat can help the crop establish before major grasshopper populations build up.
    *   **Chemical Control (Apply only when economic threshold is reached):**
        *   For nymphs and adults:
            *   **Malathion** 50% EC at 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre (in 200-400 L of water).
            *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 100-125 ml per acre (in 200-400 L of water).
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 500 ml per acre (in 200-400 L of water).

2.  **Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris):**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. The Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, radish, and cabbage.

3.  **Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus):**
    This is not known to affect Wheat. The Red cotton bug is a major pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

4.  **Black ants (Various species):**
    This is not known to affect Wheat as a direct pest causing economic damage. While ants may be present in fields, they typically do not feed on wheat plants. They might be associated with other pests like aphids (feeding on honeydew) or nesting in the soil, but direct control for ants in wheat is generally not required.
