As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice to protect wheat from environmental stresses in Haryana:

**General Principles for Stress Mitigation:**
*   **Varietal Selection:** Always choose varieties recommended for Haryana that possess inherent tolerance to specific stresses prevalent in your region (e.g., heat-tolerant, cold-tolerant).
*   **Timely Sowing:** Adhering to the optimal sowing window is crucial to allow the crop to complete its critical growth stages before the onset of severe stress conditions.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensuring adequate and balanced nutrient supply, especially Potassium (K), significantly enhances the plant's ability to withstand various stresses.
*   **Optimal Irrigation:** Timely and appropriate irrigation is a cornerstone of stress management, helping to regulate canopy temperature and maintain turgor.

### 1. Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Extreme cold and frost can cause significant damage, especially during the flowering and grain-filling stages, leading to sterility and reduced yield.

*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Apply a light irrigation (known as 'palewa' or 'life-saving irrigation') to the field just before or during a predicted frost event. Water has a higher specific heat capacity and releases latent heat as it freezes, which can raise the ambient temperature around the crop by 1-2°C, protecting the plants.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure adequate application of Potassium (K) as per soil test recommendations. Potassium plays a vital role in improving cell wall strength and osmotic regulation, thereby enhancing cold tolerance.
*   **Varietal Selection:**
    *   Opt for cold-tolerant wheat varieties recommended for Haryana.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   In anticipation of severe cold waves, a foliar spray can help:
        *   **Potassium Nitrate** (KNO3): Apply 1.0-2.0 kg per acre dissolved in 200 litres of water. This can improve the plant's physiological resilience to cold stress.

### 2. Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures, especially during the grain-filling stage, lead to forced maturity, shrivelled grains, and significant yield losses. Intense sunlight often exacerbates heat stress.

*   **Sowing Time:**
    *   Adhere strictly to the recommended early to timely sowing window (typically mid-October to mid-November for most varieties in Haryana). This allows the crop to complete its critical reproductive and grain-filling stages before the onset of severe terminal heat in March-April.
*   **Varietal Selection:**
    *   Choose heat-tolerant and early-maturing wheat varieties recommended for Haryana. These varieties are bred to perform well under rising temperatures during the later stages of crop growth.
*   **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Ensure timely and adequate irrigation, especially during the flowering and grain-filling stages. Water stress combined with heat stress is particularly damaging. Irrigation helps in evaporative cooling of the canopy.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Adequate Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) are essential for healthy plant growth, which in turn improves stress tolerance.
*   **Foliar Application:**
    *   To mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress during grain filling:
        *   **Potassium Nitrate** (KNO3): Apply 1.0-2.0 kg per acre dissolved in 200 litres of water at the anthesis (flowering) or milky grain stage. This helps in maintaining turgor, improving photosynthetic efficiency, and enhancing grain filling under heat stress.

By implementing these scientifically sound practices, farmers in Haryana can significantly reduce the impact of environmental stresses on their wheat crop, ensuring better yields and economic returns.
