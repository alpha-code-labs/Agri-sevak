Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Wheat in Haryana.

It is crucial to understand that **soil testing is the most accurate method** to determine the exact nutrient status of your soil and to formulate precise fertilizer recommendations. Visual symptoms are indicators, but soil tests provide the definitive diagnosis.

Here's how to address these macro-nutrient deficiencies:

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll formation, and protein synthesis in wheat.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tip and progressing downwards.
    *   Stunted plant growth and reduced tillering.
    *   Thin, spindly stems.
    *   Overall pale green to yellowish appearance of the crop.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **General Recommendation (based on soil test for irrigated wheat in Haryana):** Apply 120 kg Nitrogen (N) per acre. This translates to approximately 260 kg of **Urea** (46% N) per acre, split into multiple doses.
    *   **Application Timing:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** Apply 1/4th to 1/3rd of the total Nitrogen at the time of sowing.
        *   **First Top-dressing:** Apply 1/2 of the remaining Nitrogen with the first irrigation (around 21-25 days after sowing - DAS).
        *   **Second Top-dressing:** Apply the remaining Nitrogen with the second irrigation (around 45-50 DAS), especially if the crop shows signs of deficiency or if the soil is light-textured.
    *   **Foliar Application (for mild deficiency or quick boost):** In case of mild deficiency observed during growth, a foliar spray of 2% **Urea** solution (2 kg **Urea** in 100 litres of water) can be applied. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, energy transfer, tillering, flowering, and grain formation.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the margins and tips.
    *   Reduced tillering and delayed maturity.
    *   Thin stems and poor grain filling.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **General Recommendation (based on soil test for irrigated wheat in Haryana):** Apply 60 kg Phosphorus (P2O5) per acre. This translates to approximately 130 kg of **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) per acre OR approximately 375 kg of **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5) per acre.
    *   **Application Timing:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** The entire quantity of Phosphorus should be applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing. Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it needs to be placed near the root zone early on.
    *   **Note:** Foliar application of phosphorus is generally not very effective for correcting severe deficiencies due to the high requirement of the crop. Soil application is preferred.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) plays a crucial role in water regulation, disease resistance, strengthening stems, and improving grain quality and filling.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Yellowing and scorching (browning) of leaf margins, particularly on older leaves, starting from the tip.
    *   Weak stems, leading to lodging (falling over) of plants.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases and drought stress.
    *   Poor grain filling and shrivelled grains.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **General Recommendation (based on soil test for irrigated wheat in Haryana):** Apply 40 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre. This translates to approximately 67 kg of **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O) per acre.
    *   **Application Timing:**
        *   **Basal Dose:** The entire quantity of Potassium should ideally be applied as a basal dose at the time of sowing.
        *   **Split Application (for light soils):** In light-textured soils where leaching can be an issue, 50% can be applied basally and the remaining 50% with the first irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Application (for mild deficiency):** For mild deficiencies, a foliar spray of 1-2% **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** solution can be applied.

### General Recommendations and Best Practices:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before sowing to get precise recommendations for your specific field. HAU provides soil testing services.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Supplement chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure - FYM, compost) and bio-fertilizers (e.g., Azotobacter, PSB) to improve soil health and nutrient use efficiency.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced application of all macro and micro-nutrients, as deficiency of one can limit the uptake and utilization of others.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Proper irrigation is essential for nutrient uptake and utilization by the wheat crop.
