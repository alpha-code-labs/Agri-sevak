Namaste! The "drying up" of branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers in Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) is a serious symptom indicating underlying stress, which can be either abiotic (environmental) or biotic (pests and diseases). As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a thorough investigation to pinpoint the exact cause for effective management.

Here are the common causes and scientifically verified approaches to address them:

**1. Abiotic Stresses:**

*   **Water Stress (Drought or Waterlogging):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may turn yellow, wilt, scorch at margins, and eventually dry and drop. Branches may die back. Fruits and flowers may shrivel and drop prematurely.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Drought:** Ensure consistent and adequate irrigation, especially during dry spells and critical growth stages (flowering, fruit development). For mature trees, deep watering is more effective than frequent shallow watering.
        *   **Waterlogging:** Jack Fruit is highly sensitive to waterlogging. Ensure excellent drainage. Avoid planting in low-lying areas prone to water accumulation. If waterlogging occurs, improve drainage immediately by creating channels or raised beds.

*   **Nutrient Imbalance/Deficiency:**
    *   **Symptoms:** General poor growth, yellowing (chlorosis), stunted leaves, and premature drying of parts can indicate nutrient deficiencies (e.g., Potassium, Magnesium, Zinc, Boron).
    *   **Management:** Conduct a soil test and leaf tissue analysis to identify specific deficiencies. Based on the results, apply balanced fertilizers.
        *   For general health, apply well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost.
        *   Foliar sprays of micronutrients can provide quick relief if a specific deficiency is identified.

*   **Heat Stress/Sun Scorch:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Leaves may show browning or scorching, especially on the exposed side. Young fruits can also get sun-scorched and dry up.
    *   **Management:** Provide adequate irrigation to help trees cope with heat. In extreme cases, temporary shading for young trees might be beneficial. Whitewashing the trunk can help reflect heat.

**2. Biotic Stresses (Diseases and Pests):**

*   **Root Rot / Collar Rot (e.g., *Phytophthora* species):**
    *   **Symptoms:** This is a very common cause of sudden wilting and drying of entire branches or even the whole tree. Leaves turn dull green, then yellow, wilt, and dry up. The bark at the collar region (base of the trunk) or roots may show dark, water-soaked lesions, often with gum exudation, leading to girdling and death of the plant.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Improve drainage around the tree. Avoid mechanical injury to the collar region.
        *   Remove affected soil from the collar region to expose it to air.
        *   Apply fungicides as a drench around the base of the tree:
            *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** @ 2-3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** @ 2.5-3 g/L of water.
            *   **Fosetyl-Aluminium** @ 2.5-3 g/L of water.

*   **Dieback (e.g., *Botryodiplodia theobromae*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Drying of branches starting from the tip and progressing downwards. Affected branches show dark discoloration and cankers. Leaves on these branches wilt and dry.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prune affected branches well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood. Disinfect pruning tools with alcohol or bleach solution after each cut.
        *   Apply a protective fungicidal paste on the cut ends.
        *   Spray the tree with a systemic fungicide:
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L of water.
            *   **Copper Oxychloride** @ 2-3 g/L of water (as a protective spray after pruning).

*   **Anthracnose (e.g., *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Can affect leaves, flowers, and young fruits, causing dark, sunken spots. Severe infection can lead to blighting of flowers, premature fruit drop, and drying of young shoots and leaves.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts.
        *   Spray with fungicides, especially during flowering and fruit development:
            *   **Carbendazim** @ 1-2 g/L of water.
            *   **Mancozeb** @ 2-2.5 g/L of water.
            *   **Azoxystrobin** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.

*   **Stem Borers / Bark Borers:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Larvae bore into the main stem or branches, disrupting the vascular tissue that transports water and nutrients. This leads to wilting and drying of affected branches or even the entire tree. Presence of frass (sawdust-like material) and boreholes are key indicators.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Locate the boreholes. Insert a thin wire into the hole to kill the larva.
        *   Inject an insecticide solution into the boreholes and plug them with mud or cotton:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos** @ 2-3 ml/L of water.
            *   **Imidacloprid** @ 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
        *   Maintain tree vigor to help it withstand pest attacks.

**General Recommendations for Healthy Jack Fruit Cultivation:**

*   **Proper Site Selection:** Choose well-drained soil and avoid waterlogged areas.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Regular soil testing and application of recommended fertilizers.
*   **Pruning:** Remove dead, diseased, or weak branches regularly to improve air circulation and plant vigor.
*   **Sanitation:** Keep the area around the tree clean by removing fallen leaves, fruits, and weeds.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your trees for early signs of stress, pests, or diseases.

**Crucial Advice:**
Given the general nature of "drying up" as a symptom, it is highly recommended to consult with a local agricultural expert or visit the HAU Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) in your district. They can conduct an on-site inspection for an accurate diagnosis and provide precise recommendations tailored to your specific situation and local conditions.
