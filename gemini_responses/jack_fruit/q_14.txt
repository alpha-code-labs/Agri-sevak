Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand the challenges posed by soil pests like termites and nematodes in perennial crops like Jackfruit. Effective management is crucial for healthy tree growth and good yields. Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling these pests in Jackfruit:

### 1. Termite Control (Deemak Niyantran)

Termites can cause significant damage, especially to young Jackfruit trees or stressed older trees, by feeding on the bark and wood, leading to weakening or even death of the plant.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all dead wood, stumps, and debris from the orchard, as these can serve as breeding grounds for termites.
*   **Avoid Direct Soil Contact:** Ensure that no wooden stakes or supports are in direct contact with the soil, as this can provide a pathway for termites to reach the tree.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as very dry conditions can sometimes encourage termite activity.
*   **Regular Inspection:** Periodically check the base of the trees for termite mud tubes. If found, scrape them off and apply control measures.

**B. Chemical Control (as per CIBRC approval):**
For effective chemical control, a soil drench around the base of the tree is recommended.

*   **For existing trees:**
    *   Use **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at a concentration of 2.5 ml per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of the tree, ensuring the solution penetrates the root zone. The quantity of solution will depend on the tree size, typically 5-10 litres per tree for young trees.
*   **For new plantings (pre-treatment of pits):**
    *   Before planting, mix **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** at 2.5 ml per litre of water and drench the planting pit thoroughly. Allow the soil to absorb the solution before planting the sapling.

### 2. Nematode (Root-knot) Control (Sutra Krumi Niyantran)

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are microscopic worms that infect the roots, causing characteristic galls or knots. This impairs the roots' ability to absorb water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, reduced vigour, and poor fruit production.

**A. Cultural and Biological Methods (Preferred for long-term sustainability):**
*   **Soil Solarization:** In areas where new Jackfruit trees are to be planted, especially in nursery beds, solarization during hot summer months (May-June) can significantly reduce nematode populations. Cover moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks.
*   **Organic Matter Addition:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM), compost, or green manure into the soil. This improves soil health and encourages beneficial microorganisms that can suppress nematode populations.
*   **Neem Cake Application:** Apply **Neem Cake** (Sarson ki Khali) at the rate of 1-2 kg per tree, mixed into the soil around the root zone, twice a year (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon). Neem cake releases compounds that are toxic to nematodes and also enhances beneficial microbial activity.
*   **Biological Nematicides:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*): Apply this bio-nematicide at 5 kg per acre, mixed with 100 kg of FYM or compost. Apply around the root zone of the trees. This fungus parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
    *   **Trichoderma viride:** While primarily a fungicide, *Trichoderma* spp. can also help in suppressing nematodes indirectly by improving soil health and competing with pathogens. Apply at 2-3 kg per acre mixed with FYM.

**B. Chemical Control (Use only if severe infestation and cultural/biological methods are insufficient):**
Chemical nematicides should be used judiciously and as a last resort, strictly following label instructions and CIBRC guidelines.

*   **Oxamyl 24% SL:** This nematicide can be applied as a soil drench. The recommended dosage is typically 2-3 ml per litre of water, applied around the root zone of the tree. The quantity of solution will depend on the tree size. Ensure proper soil moisture before and after application.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Jackfruit trees for any signs of pest damage. Early detection allows for timely and effective intervention.
*   **Maintain Tree Health:** Healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks. Ensure proper nutrition, irrigation, and pruning practices.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions, always consult with the agricultural extension officers at HAU or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK).

By adopting these scientifically sound practices, you can effectively manage soil pests in your Jackfruit orchard and ensure healthy, productive trees.
