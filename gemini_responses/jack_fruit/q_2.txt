As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding rust diseases in Jack Fruit:

*   **Black Rust, Brown Rust, Yellow Rust, and White Rust:** These specific rust diseases are primarily known to affect cereal crops (Black, Brown, Yellow rusts) or cruciferous vegetables (White rust). **This is not known to affect Jack Fruit.**

*   **Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*):** This condition, often referred to as "red rust," is actually caused by a parasitic alga, *Cephaleuros virescens*, and not a true fungus. It is a common problem in tropical fruit trees, including Jack Fruit, especially under humid conditions and in neglected orchards.

**Symptoms of Red Rust on Jack Fruit:**
*   Velvety, reddish-brown, circular patches appear on the upper surface of leaves, young twigs, and sometimes on fruits.
*   On twigs, these lesions can coalesce, girdle the stem, and cause dieback.
*   Severe infection can lead to defoliation and reduced fruit yield.

**Control Measures for Red Rust (*Cephaleuros virescens*) in Jack Fruit:**

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Pruning:** Regularly prune the tree to remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches. This improves air circulation within the canopy, reducing humidity which favors algal growth.
*   **Sanitation:** Collect and destroy all fallen infected leaves and twigs to reduce inoculum.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree free of weeds to further improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   **Nutrition:** Ensure the tree receives balanced nutrition to maintain its vigor and natural resistance. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage, as waterlogging can stress trees and make them more susceptible.

**2. Chemical Control (Fungicides/Algaecides):**
For effective control, especially during periods of high humidity or when symptoms are observed, apply CIBRC-approved copper-based formulations.

*   **Copper oxychloride:**
    *   Apply a spray solution of **Copper oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and affected branches.
    *   Repeat application if necessary, especially after heavy rains, following label instructions.

*   **Bordeaux Mixture:**
    *   A 1% Bordeaux mixture (1 kg **Copper sulfate** + 1 kg **Calcium hydroxide** in 100 L of water) can also be highly effective.
    *   Prepare freshly and apply immediately.
    *   This provides good protective action against the alga.

**Application Timing:**
*   Initiate sprays at the first sign of the disease.
*   In areas with a history of red rust, a prophylactic spray before the monsoon season or during periods of high humidity can be beneficial.

Always follow the specific instructions and safety precautions mentioned on the product label.
