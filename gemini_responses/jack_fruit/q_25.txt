As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice on irrigation management for Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Haryana:

Jack fruit is a tropical tree that requires adequate and consistent moisture, especially during its establishment and fruit development stages. However, it is highly sensitive to waterlogging, which can lead to root rot and tree decline. Therefore, proper drainage is as crucial as timely irrigation.

### Irrigation Management for Jack Fruit

**1. First Irrigation:**
*   **Timing:** The first irrigation is critical and should be provided immediately after planting the jack fruit saplings.
*   **Purpose:** This ensures proper settling of the soil around the roots, eliminates air pockets, and helps the plant establish quickly by providing essential moisture for initial root development.
*   **Method:** Apply water gently but thoroughly to saturate the root ball and surrounding soil without causing waterlogging.

**2. Second Irrigation and Subsequent Irrigations:**
*   **Second Irrigation:** Typically, the second irrigation should be given 7-10 days after the first, depending on the soil moisture status and prevailing weather conditions. Always check the soil moisture before irrigating.
*   **Establishment Phase (First 1-2 years):**
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture. During dry periods, especially in the hot summer months of Haryana, irrigate every 7-10 days.
    *   Reduce frequency during the monsoon season or cooler months, but do not allow the soil to dry out completely.
*   **Bearing Phase (Mature Trees):**
    *   **Critical Stages:** The most critical periods for irrigation are during flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Water stress during these stages can lead to flower and fruit drop, reduced fruit size, and poor quality.
    *   **Frequency:** During dry spells in summer, irrigate every 10-15 days. In cooler months or after monsoon, irrigation frequency can be reduced significantly or even stopped if sufficient soil moisture is present.
    *   **General Guideline:** Irrigate when the top 15-20 cm of soil begins to feel dry to the touch. The amount of water per irrigation will depend on the tree size, soil type, and weather, but aim to moisten the root zone thoroughly without creating standing water.

**3. Sprinkler Use (and Drip Irrigation):**
*   **Efficiency:** Both sprinkler and drip irrigation systems are highly recommended for jack fruit cultivation in Haryana due to their superior water-use efficiency compared to traditional flood irrigation. Given the increasing water scarcity in many parts of Haryana, these systems are economically and environmentally beneficial.
*   **Drip Irrigation:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Drip irrigation is particularly ideal for jack fruit trees. It delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation losses, reducing weed growth, and preventing waterlogging around the trunk.
    *   **Application Rate:** For mature jack fruit trees, typically 20-40 litres of water per plant per day may be required during peak demand periods (hot summer, fruit development), adjusted based on tree size, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions. This can be delivered through 2-4 drippers per tree.
    *   **Benefits:** Precise water delivery, reduced water consumption, improved nutrient uptake (through fertigation), better aeration in the root zone, and higher yields with better fruit quality.
*   **Sprinkler Irrigation:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Micro-sprinklers or mini-sprinklers can also be used effectively. They provide better water distribution uniformity than flood irrigation and are more efficient.
    *   **Considerations:** While effective, drip irrigation is generally preferred for tree crops like jack fruit due to its even higher efficiency and direct root zone application, which also helps in keeping the foliage dry, potentially reducing certain fungal issues.

**Key Considerations:**
*   **Soil Type:** Sandy soils require more frequent but lighter irrigations, while clayey soils need less frequent but heavier irrigations.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Adjust irrigation frequency based on temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulch around the base of the trees helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature, thereby reducing irrigation frequency.
