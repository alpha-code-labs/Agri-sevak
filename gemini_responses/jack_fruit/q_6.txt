As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Jack Fruit:

It is important to understand that there are no direct chemical cures (viricides) for plant viral diseases once a plant is infected. Management strategies primarily focus on preventing infection, controlling the insect vectors that transmit these viruses, and maintaining plant health.

First, let's address the specific diseases mentioned:

*   **Stripe virus:** This is not known to affect Jack Fruit. Stripe viruses are typically associated with monocotyledonous crops like cereals.
*   **Tristeza virus:** This is not known to affect Jack Fruit. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) is specific to citrus and related Rutaceae family members.

For **Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, and Stunt virus**, these are symptoms that can be caused by various viral infections in Jack Fruit. The primary approach to managing these potential viral issues involves an integrated strategy:

**Integrated Management for Viral Diseases in Jack Fruit:**

1.  **Use Healthy Planting Material:**
    *   Always source saplings from certified, disease-free nurseries. This is the most crucial step to prevent the introduction of viruses.

2.  **Vector Control:**
    *   Most plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors such as whiteflies, aphids, thrips, and mealybugs. Controlling these vectors is paramount to prevent the spread of viral diseases.
    *   Regular monitoring of the orchard for the presence of these sucking pests is essential.
    *   **Chemical Control (Insecticides):** Apply CIBRC approved insecticides when vector populations are high. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
        *   For Whiteflies and Aphids:
            *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.5 - 1 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
            *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water.
        *   For Mealybugs (often found on stems and fruits):
            *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** 1.25 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** 0.75 ml per litre of water.
        *   For Thrips:
            *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water.

3.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Many weeds can act as alternate hosts for viruses and their insect vectors. Keep the orchard free of weeds.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced fertilization to maintain plant vigour, which can help plants tolerate stress better.
    *   **Irrigation:** Provide adequate and timely irrigation to avoid water stress.

4.  **Sanitation:**
    *   **Rogueing:** Promptly remove and destroy severely infected plants or plant parts (e.g., leaves, branches showing severe symptoms) to reduce the source of inoculum. Do not compost infected material.
    *   **Tool Sterilization:** Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or alcohol after working on each tree to prevent mechanical transmission of viruses.

5.  **Physical Barriers (for nurseries/young plants):**
    *   In nursery settings, using insect-proof nets can help protect young plants from insect vectors.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can significantly reduce the incidence and spread of viral diseases in your Jack Fruit orchard. Regular monitoring and timely intervention are key to successful disease management.
