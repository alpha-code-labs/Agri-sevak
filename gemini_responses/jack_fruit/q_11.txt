As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Jack Fruit in Haryana:

### Control of Beetles in Jack Fruit

The most significant beetle pest affecting Jack Fruit in our region is the **Jackfruit Stem Borer (Batocera rufomaculata)**. This pest can cause severe damage, leading to wilting of branches and even death of the tree if not managed effectively.

**Symptoms of Stem Borer Infestation:**
*   Presence of boreholes on the trunk and main branches.
*   Extrusion of frass (sawdust-like material mixed with excreta) from the boreholes.
*   Gummosis (oozing of sap) from the affected areas.
*   Wilting and drying of branches, eventually leading to the death of the affected part or the entire tree.

**Control Measures:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Periodically inspect trees for signs of infestation, especially boreholes and frass.
    *   **Mechanical Removal:** If boreholes are accessible, use a hooked wire to physically extract the grubs from the tunnels.
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested or dead branches to prevent further spread.
    *   **Tree Health:** Maintain tree vigor through proper irrigation, fertilization, and sanitation, as healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks.

2.  **Chemical Control (for active infestations):**
    *   **Injection Method:** This is the most effective method for controlling borers inside the stem.
        *   Clean the boreholes thoroughly to remove all frass.
        *   Inject 5-10 ml of an insecticide solution into each active borehole using a syringe.
        *   Recommended insecticides and dosages:
            *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5 ml per litre of water.
            *   **Dichlorvos 76% EC**: Mix 1 ml per litre of water.
        *   Immediately after injection, seal the boreholes with mud or wet clay to prevent the escape of insecticide fumes and to ensure the insecticide acts effectively on the grub.
    *   **Swab Method:** As an alternative to injection, soak cotton wool in the above-mentioned insecticide solution and insert it deeply into the boreholes, then seal the holes.
