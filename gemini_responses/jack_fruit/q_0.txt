Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing fungal diseases in Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Haryana.

Effective management of fungal diseases in Jack Fruit requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides.

**General Cultural Practices for Fungal Disease Management:**

1.  **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, twigs, and diseased fruits. Prune out dead or diseased branches promptly.
2.  **Pruning:** Ensure proper canopy management through regular pruning to improve air circulation and light penetration, which reduces humidity within the canopy, making it less conducive for fungal growth.
3.  **Spacing:** Maintain adequate spacing between trees during planting to prevent overcrowding.
4.  **Nutrition:** Provide balanced nutrition to trees. Over-fertilization with nitrogen can lead to lush, soft growth that is more susceptible to fungal infections.
5.  **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal spore germination and infection. If irrigation is necessary, use drip irrigation or water at the base of the tree in the morning.
6.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for the region, consider planting disease-tolerant or resistant varieties.

**Specific Fungal Diseases and Their Control in Jack Fruit:**

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria* spp.)

**Symptoms:** Characterized by small, dark brown to black spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, which can enlarge and coalesce, leading to defoliation.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** As above, especially sanitation and pruning.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water can be effective.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water provides broad-spectrum control.

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum* spp.)

**Symptoms:** A major disease affecting leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruits. On leaves, it causes irregular dark brown to black spots. On twigs, it can cause dieback. On fruits, it appears as sunken, dark spots, often with pinkish spore masses in humid conditions, leading to fruit rot.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Crucial to remove infected plant parts and fallen fruits.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Regular prophylactic sprays with **Mancozeb** at 2.0-2.5 g/L of water or **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   Systemic fungicides like **Carbendazim** at 0.5-1.0 g/L of water, **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water, or **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water are highly effective.
    *   A combination product containing **Carbendazim + Mancozeb** (e.g., 1.5-2.0 g/L of water) can provide both systemic and contact action.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water is also very effective.

### 3. Blight (General Leaf/Twig Blight)

**Symptoms:** Can manifest as rapid browning and death of leaves, twigs, or even entire branches. Often associated with severe infections by fungi like *Colletotrichum* or other pathogens.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Promptly prune and destroy blighted branches. Improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Sprays with broad-spectrum fungicides like **Copper Oxychloride** at 2.5-3.0 g/L of water or **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water.
    *   Systemic options such as **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water or **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1.0 ml/L of water can help control the spread.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water is also recommended.

### 4. Brown Spot

**Symptoms:** Brown spot is a general symptom often associated with various leaf spot diseases, including *Alternaria* and *Colletotrichum*.

**Control Measures:**
*   The control measures for Alternaria Leaf Spot and Anthracnose will effectively manage brown spot symptoms.

### 5. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Oidium* spp. or similar fungi)

**Symptoms:** Appears as white, powdery patches on the surface of young leaves, shoots, and sometimes flowers. Infected leaves may curl, distort, and eventually turn yellow and drop.

**Control Measures:**
*   **Cultural:** Prune to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Spray with **Wettable Sulphur** at 2.0-3.0 g/L of water (avoid spraying in very hot weather).
    *   Systemic fungicides like **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water, **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.5 g/L of water, or **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water are highly effective.

**Diseases Not Known to Affect Jack Fruit:**

*   **Blast:** This is not known to affect Jack Fruit.
*   **Downy Mildew:** This is not known to affect Jack Fruit.
*   **Grey Mildew:** This is not known to affect Jack Fruit as a distinct disease.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, it is crucial to rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply fungicides preventively, especially during periods conducive to disease development (e.g., high humidity, rainy season, flowering, and fruit development).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves, for effective control.
*   **Safety:** Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label regarding dosage, application method, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions.

For any specific concerns or severe outbreaks, it is always advisable to consult with the plant pathology department at HAU, Hisar, or your local agricultural extension officer for precise diagnosis and recommendations.
