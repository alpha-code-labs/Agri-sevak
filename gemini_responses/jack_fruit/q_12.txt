Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that Scale insects and Mealybugs are common sap-sucking pests that can significantly affect Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) trees in Haryana, leading to stunted growth, sooty mould development, and reduced fruit quality and yield. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control Scale insects and Mealybugs in Jack Fruit:

**I. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:**
An IPM approach combines various strategies to manage pests effectively while minimizing environmental impact and ensuring food safety.

**II. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
These methods are the first line of defense and should be implemented regularly.

*   **Pruning:** Regularly inspect trees and prune heavily infested branches, twigs, or leaves. Dispose of the pruned material by burning or burying it away from the orchard to prevent further spread.
*   **Water Jet Spray:** For localized infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and young scales from the plant surface.
*   **Manual Removal:** For small trees or accessible infestations, mealybugs can be physically removed using a brush or by hand.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the jackfruit trees free of weeds, as they can harbor these pests.
*   **Ant Control:** Ants often protect mealybugs and scales to feed on their honeydew. Control ant populations by banding tree trunks with sticky barriers or using ant baits.

**III. Biological Control:**
Encouraging natural enemies can significantly reduce pest populations.

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm beneficial insects.
*   **Predators:** Ladybird beetles (e.g., *Cryptolaemus montrouzieri*) and lacewings are effective predators of mealybugs and scales.
*   **Parasitoids:** Tiny wasps (e.g., *Anagyrus lopezi* for mealybugs, various encyrtid wasps for scales) lay their eggs inside the pests, killing them.

**IV. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort):**
If cultural and biological methods are insufficient, chemical control may be required. Always follow label instructions carefully, including dosage, timing, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI). Apply sprays thoroughly, ensuring good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in crevices where pests hide.

*   **For Mealybugs and Scale Insects:**
    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO) / White Oil:** Apply at a concentration of 10-20 ml/L of water. This works by suffocating the pests. It is effective against all stages, especially crawlers and young scales. Repeat application may be needed.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml/L of water. This is an insect growth regulator that interferes with molting, primarily effective against nymphs and crawlers.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75-1 ml/L of water. This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of sap-sucking pests.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water. This is a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water. Another systemic neonicotinoid, effective against sucking pests.

**V. Important Precautions:**

*   **Safety Gear:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, and protective clothing when handling and applying pesticides.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the PHI mentioned on the pesticide label to ensure the fruit is safe for consumption.
*   **Consult Experts:** For severe or persistent infestations, consult with agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for specific recommendations.

By adopting these scientifically verified practices, you can effectively manage Scale insects and Mealybugs in your Jack Fruit orchard.
