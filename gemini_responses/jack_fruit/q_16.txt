As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Jackfruit cultivation in Haryana. Please note that these are general recommendations, and a soil test is highly recommended to determine the precise nutrient requirements for your specific orchard.

**General Principles for Fertilizer Application:**

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before applying fertilizers to understand the existing nutrient status and pH of your soil.
*   **Split Application:** Fertilizers should generally be applied in two equal splits:
    *   First split: During May-June (pre-monsoon).
    *   Second split: During September-October (post-monsoon).
*   **Application Method:** Apply fertilizers in a ring around the tree, 30-60 cm away from the trunk, within the drip line, and incorporate them into the soil by light digging. Ensure adequate moisture after application.

### Fertilizer Recommendations for Jackfruit

#### I. For Young/Non-Bearing Trees (1-3 years)

The aim during this stage is to promote vigorous vegetative growth.

*   **Year 1 (per tree per year):**
    *   **Urea**: 200-250 g
    *   **DAP**: 100-125 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 100-125 g
    *   **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%): 20-30 g (if not using SSP)
*   **Year 2 (per tree per year):**
    *   **Urea**: 400-500 g
    *   **DAP**: 200-250 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 200-250 g
    *   **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%): 40-50 g (if not using SSP)
*   **Year 3 (per tree per year):**
    *   **Urea**: 600-750 g
    *   **DAP**: 300-375 g
    *   **Muriate of Potash**: 300-375 g
    *   **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%): 60-75 g (if not using SSP)

#### II. For Bearing Trees (4 years onwards)

For mature, fruit-bearing trees, the nutrient requirement is higher to support fruit production and maintain tree health. The following doses are recommended per tree per year, to be applied in two equal splits.

**Option 1: Using DAP for Phosphorus**

*   **Urea**: 1.25 - 1.5 kg
*   **DAP**: 800 g - 1 kg
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 1.25 - 1.5 kg
*   **Sulphur** (elemental, 90%): 150 - 200 g (This is important as DAP provides minimal Sulphur)

**Option 2: Using SSP for Phosphorus and Sulphur**

*   **Urea**: 1.5 - 1.75 kg (as SSP provides less N than DAP)
*   **SSP**: 2.2 - 2.5 kg (This will also provide sufficient Sulphur)
*   **Muriate of Potash**: 1.25 - 1.5 kg

#### III. Nano-Fertilizers

Nano-fertilizers are designed for foliar application and offer high nutrient use efficiency. They are typically used as supplementary nutrition.

*   **Nano-Urea**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application**: Apply 2-3 foliar sprays during critical growth stages (e.g., pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development). This can significantly reduce the requirement for conventional **Urea**.
*   **Nano-DAP**:
    *   **Dose**: 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application**: Apply 2-3 foliar sprays, particularly during flowering and fruit development stages. This can supplement the phosphorus requirement.

#### IV. NPK (Complex Fertilizers)

If using complex NPK fertilizers (e.g., 15:15:15, 19:19:19), calculate the amount required to meet the N, P2O5, and K2O recommendations mentioned above. For instance, if you need 750g N, 375g P2O5, and 750g K2O, and you are using NPK 15:15:15, you would need approximately 5 kg of NPK 15:15:15 per tree per year (5000g * 0.15 = 750g of each nutrient). However, it is often more cost-effective and precise to use straight fertilizers like **Urea**, **DAP**, **SSP**, and **Muriate of Potash** to meet specific nutrient needs.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Micronutrients:** Jackfruit also requires micronutrients like Zinc (Zn), Boron (B), Manganese (Mn), and Iron (Fe). If soil tests indicate deficiencies, apply appropriate micronutrient mixtures or specific micronutrient fertilizers as per recommendations. For example, Zinc Sulphate (200-300 g/tree) and Borax (50-100 g/tree) can be applied every 2-3 years if deficiencies are noted.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplement chemical fertilizers with 20-50 kg of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per tree per year, applied during the monsoon season. This improves soil health, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper irrigation, especially after fertilizer application, for efficient nutrient uptake.

Always consult with local agricultural extension officers or HAU experts for tailored advice based on your specific farm conditions.
