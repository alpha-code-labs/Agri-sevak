As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Jack Fruit in Haryana:

### Control of Pests in Jack Fruit

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers are generalist feeders and can cause damage to the leaves and young shoots of Jack Fruit trees.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   For small infestations, hand-picking and destroying the nymphs and adults can be effective.
    *   Deep ploughing during the off-season can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For moderate to severe infestations, the following CIBRC approved insecticides can be used:
        *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**2. Painted Bug**
This is not known to affect Jack Fruit. Painted bug (Bagrada hilaris) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and cauliflower.

**3. Red Cotton Bug**
This is not known to affect Jack Fruit. Red cotton bug (Dysdercus cingulatus) is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black Ants**
Black ants themselves generally do not cause direct significant damage to Jack Fruit trees or fruits. However, they are often associated with honeydew-producing pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, which they protect in exchange for honeydew. They can also be a nuisance or nest in the tree.

*   **Cultural and Physical Control:**
    *   Remove any debris or weeds around the base of the tree that might provide shelter for ants.
    *   Prune branches that are touching the ground or other structures, creating bridges for ants to access the tree.
    *   Apply sticky bands or grease around the trunk of the tree to prevent ants from climbing up.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   If ants are present due to the farming of honeydew-producing pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects), the most effective strategy is to control the primary pest. For example, for aphids or mealybugs:
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Apply at 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   If ants are nesting in the tree or causing a direct nuisance, and other methods are insufficient:
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Apply at 2.5 ml per litre of water as a drench around the base of the tree or directly into visible ant nests.
