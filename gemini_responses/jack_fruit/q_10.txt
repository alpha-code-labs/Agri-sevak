Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Jack Fruit (Kathal).

Here's how to manage these pests:

### 1. Borers

Jack fruit is primarily affected by stem borers and fruit borers.

*   **Stem Borers (e.g., *Batocera rufomaculata*, *Plocaederus obesus*)**:
    *   **Identification**: Presence of boreholes on the trunk or branches, frass (excreta) near the holes, and wilting of branches.
    *   **Control Measures**:
        *   **Mechanical**: Locate the boreholes and remove the grubs using a hooked wire.
        *   **Chemical**: Inject 2-3 ml of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC (2 ml/L of water) or **Dichlorvos** 76% EC (1 ml/L of water) into each borehole using a syringe. After injection, plug the holes with wet mud or cotton soaked in the insecticide solution to prevent the escape of fumes and ensure efficacy. Repeat if new boreholes appear.

*   **Fruit Borers (e.g., *Glyphodes caesalis*)**:
    *   **Identification**: Larvae bore into young fruits, causing internal damage and premature fruit drop.
    *   **Control Measures**:
        *   **Mechanical**: Collect and destroy all infested and fallen fruits to break the pest cycle.
        *   **Chemical**: At the fruit initiation stage, if infestation is observed, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water or **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water. Ensure thorough coverage of developing fruits.

### 2. Caterpillars (General Defoliators and Fruit Borers)

Various caterpillars can cause defoliation or damage to fruits and shoots.

*   **Identification**: Chewed leaves, presence of larvae on leaves or fruits, silk webbing.
*   **Control Measures**:
    *   **Mechanical**: Hand-pick and destroy larger caterpillars, especially in young orchards.
    *   **Biological**: For early stages of infestation, consider using formulations of *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) as per product recommendations.
    *   **Chemical**: In case of severe infestation, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water or **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water. Ensure good coverage of foliage.

### 3. Diamondback Moth (*Plutella xylostella*)

This is not known to affect Jack Fruit. Diamondback moth is a specific pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

### 4. Leaf Folder

While specific leaf folder species are not major pests of Jack Fruit, some caterpillars might exhibit leaf-folding behavior.

*   **Identification**: Leaves folded or rolled, with larvae feeding inside the fold, skeletonized patches on leaves.
*   **Control Measures**:
    *   **Mechanical**: Remove and destroy folded leaves containing larvae.
    *   **Chemical**: If infestation is significant, spray with **Emamectin benzoate** 5% SG at 0.2 g/L of water or **Chlorantraniliprole** 18.5% SC at 0.3 ml/L of water or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1 ml/L of water. Focus on covering the affected foliage.

**General Advisory**:
*   Always read the label instructions carefully before using any pesticide.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   Follow recommended dosage and waiting periods (pre-harvest interval).
*   Practice integrated pest management (IPM) by combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific advice tailored to your farm conditions.
