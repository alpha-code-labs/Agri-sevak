Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide scientifically verified advice for managing these conditions in Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Haryana.

It is important to note that maintaining good orchard hygiene, proper nutrition, and adequate water management are foundational to preventing and managing most plant diseases.

### 1. Scab

Scab in Jack Fruit is primarily caused by the fungus *Sphaceloma artocarpi*. It affects leaves, young shoots, and fruits, causing characteristic raised, corky lesions.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune and destroy infected twigs, leaves, and fruits to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy through judicious pruning.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Initiate spraying at the fruit setting stage and repeat every 15-20 days if the disease pressure is high.
    *   Spray with:
        *   **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) @ 2.5-3 grams per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Carbendazim** (50% WP) @ 1 gram per litre of water.

### 2. Canker

Canker in Jack Fruit can be caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora palmivora*, *Botryodiplodia theobromae*) or sometimes bacteria, leading to sunken, discolored lesions on the bark, often accompanied by gum exudation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches, as these serve as entry points for pathogens.
    *   Prune out affected branches well below the cankered area, ensuring clean cuts. Sterilize pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution between cuts.
    *   Scrape off the diseased bark tissue from the canker until healthy wood is exposed.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For wound dressing:** After scraping the canker, apply a thick paste made from **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) @ 50 grams mixed with 100 ml of water directly onto the wound.
    *   **For spraying (preventive/curative):**
        *   Spray the affected trees with **Propiconazole** (25% EC) @ 1 ml per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) @ 2.5 grams per litre of water, especially if *Phytophthora* species are suspected.

### 3. Gummosis

Gummosis is a symptom characterized by the exudation of amber-colored gum from the bark of the tree. It is often associated with canker diseases (particularly those caused by *Phytophthora* species), physiological stress, or mechanical injuries.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Improve soil drainage around the tree base to prevent waterlogging, which stresses trees and favors *Phytophthora* infections.
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition for the tree to enhance its natural resistance.
    *   Avoid injuries to the trunk and roots.
    *   Follow the same wound management practices as described for Canker (scraping and paste application).
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For wound dressing:** Apply a paste of **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) @ 50 grams in 100 ml of water to the affected areas after scraping.
    *   **For drenching/spraying (if fungal infection is the cause):**
        *   Drench the soil around the tree base or spray the trunk with **Fosetyl-aluminium** (80% WP) @ 2.5 grams per litre of water.
        *   Alternatively, spray with **Propiconazole** (25% EC) @ 1 ml per litre of water.

### 4. Lichen

Lichen is not a disease or a pest of Jack Fruit. Lichens are symbiotic organisms composed of a fungus and an alga, which grow superficially on the bark of trees. They do not parasitize the tree or draw nutrients from it. Their presence usually indicates good air quality and can sometimes suggest that the tree is growing slowly or is in a humid, shaded environment.

**Control Measures (if removal is desired for aesthetic reasons or to improve bark health):**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Improve air circulation and light penetration to the tree trunk and branches through judicious pruning of the canopy.
    *   Gently scrub the bark with a stiff brush and plain water during the dry season to dislodge the lichens.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Chemical control is generally not necessary as lichens are harmless. However, if removal is strongly desired, a very dilute solution of **Copper Oxychloride** (50% WP) @ 0.5 grams per litre of water can be sprayed on the affected bark. This can help in dislodging them, but it is important to use it sparingly and only if absolutely necessary, as it is not targeting a pathogen.
