As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I understand the unique challenges posed by Haryana's climate to tropical fruits like Jack Fruit. Protecting Jack Fruit from environmental stress is crucial for its survival and productivity in our region. Here's how you can protect your Jack Fruit plants:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Jack Fruit is highly sensitive to cold and frost, which can cause severe damage, especially to young plants.

*   **Site Selection:** Plant Jack Fruit in locations that are naturally warmer, such as near buildings or walls that radiate heat, or on higher ground where cold air drains away.
*   **Mulching:** Apply a thick layer (10-15 cm) of organic mulch (straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the tree. This insulates the soil, retains warmth, and protects roots from freezing.
*   **Irrigation:** Lightly irrigate the soil around the tree a day or two before a predicted frost event. Moist soil retains more heat than dry soil and releases it slowly overnight, raising the ambient temperature slightly.
*   **Covering Young Plants:** For young trees (1-3 years old), cover them with gunny bags, straw, plastic sheets, or specialized frost covers during cold nights. Ensure the cover does not touch the foliage directly. Remove covers during the day to allow sunlight and air circulation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant shelterbelts or windbreaks (e.g., fast-growing trees like Eucalyptus or Poplar) on the northern and western sides of the orchard to protect against cold, dry winter winds.
*   **Smudge Fires (for severe frost in orchards):** In large orchards, creating small, controlled smudge fires using agricultural waste on the upwind side can generate smoke and warm air, helping to prevent frost formation. This requires careful management and safety precautions.

### Protection from Heat/Loo (Hot Winds) and Intense Sunlight

Haryana's summers are characterized by extreme heat and dry, hot winds (Loo), which can cause leaf scorch, fruit drop, and stress.

*   **Adequate Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and sufficient irrigation, especially during peak summer months. Water deeply in the early morning or late evening to minimize evaporation. Young plants may require daily watering during severe heat.
*   **Mulching:** Maintain a thick layer of mulch around the tree to conserve soil moisture, reduce soil temperature, and suppress weeds that compete for water.
*   **Shade for Young Plants:** For young Jack Fruit plants, provide temporary shade during the hottest part of the day (11 AM to 4 PM) using shade nets (30-50% shade) or by planting them under the partial shade of taller, established trees.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish windbreaks on the western and southern sides of the orchard to protect against hot, dry Loo winds, which can desiccate foliage and flowers.
*   **Trunk Whitewashing:** Paint the main trunk and lower branches with a lime wash (calcium carbonate solution) to reflect sunlight and reduce bark temperature, preventing sunscald.
*   **Kaolin Clay Spray:** For fruits and foliage exposed to intense sunlight, especially on younger trees or newly exposed fruits, consider spraying a **Kaolin** clay solution. This forms a reflective white film that reduces surface temperature and sunburn.
    *   **Application:** Mix **Kaolin** clay at a rate of 2.5-5 kg per 100 litres of water (25-50 g/L).
    *   **Frequency:** Apply every 2-4 weeks during periods of intense heat and sunlight, or after heavy rains. Ensure thorough coverage of fruits and exposed leaves.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly enhance the resilience of your Jack Fruit plants against the challenging environmental conditions of Haryana.
