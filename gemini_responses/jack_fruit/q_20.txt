Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) for the Haryana region.

It is crucial to first confirm any suspected deficiency through soil testing and, if possible, leaf tissue analysis. Visual symptoms can sometimes be misleading. The recommendations below are general guidelines; specific dosages may need adjustment based on the severity of the deficiency and local soil conditions.

Here's how to address the specified micronutrient deficiencies:

### General Recommendations for Micronutrient Application:

*   **Diagnosis is Key:** Always conduct soil and leaf tissue analysis to accurately diagnose the deficiency and determine the precise requirement.
*   **Foliar Application:** Generally preferred for quick correction of deficiencies, especially during active growth periods. Apply sprays in the morning or late afternoon to avoid scorching and ensure better absorption.
*   **Soil Application:** Suitable for long-term correction and maintenance, especially for immobile nutrients or severe deficiencies.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for all sprays.
*   **Adjuvant:** A non-ionic spreader/sticker can improve the efficacy of foliar sprays.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Combine micronutrient management with balanced NPK fertilization and good horticultural practices.

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Small leaves (often called 'little leaf'), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, rosetting of leaves, reduced shoot growth, and poor fruit development.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) at 2-5 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) at 1.5-3 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals, especially during new flush emergence.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 10-25 kg/acre, or **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** at 6-15 kg/acre, mixed with farmyard manure (FYM) and broadcast around the tree basin, then lightly incorporated into the soil. This is typically done once a year or based on soil test recommendations.

### 2. Iron (Fe) / Ferrous Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, with veins remaining distinctly green. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or almost white, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** (19% Fe) at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals until symptoms disappear.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 25-50 kg/acre, or **Ferrous EDTA** at 5-10 kg/acre, mixed with FYM. This is more effective in acidic to neutral soils. For alkaline soils prevalent in Haryana, foliar application or chelated forms are generally more effective.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dieback of growing points, distorted and thickened leaves, cracking of fruits, internal browning or corky tissue in fruits, poor fruit set, and sometimes premature fruit drop.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) at 1-2 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) at 2-4 g/L of water.
    *   Spray during flowering and fruit development stages.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Borax** at 5-10 kg/acre, or **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** at 2-5 kg/acre, mixed with FYM. Apply once a year, preferably before the active growth phase.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Dieback of terminal buds and root tips, stunted growth, distorted new leaves, marginal necrosis (browning of leaf edges) on young leaves, and poor fruit quality. While blossom end rot is a classic symptom in some fruits, it's less common in jackfruit.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Apply **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca) at 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, apply **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca) at 3-7 g/L of water.
    *   Spray during fruit development stages to improve fruit quality and shelf life.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Calcium Nitrate** at 50-100 kg/acre as a general fertilizer. For long-term soil amendment and to address severe soil calcium deficiency, **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate) can be applied, especially in sodic soils, at higher rates (e.g., 2-5 tonnes/acre) based on soil test recommendations.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, starting from the leaf margins and progressing inwards, often with reddish or purplish tints. In severe cases, leaves may drop prematurely.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) at 5-10 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 15-day intervals until symptoms subside.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 25-50 kg/acre, mixed with FYM, once a year.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

**Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on younger leaves, similar to iron deficiency but often less severe, with a finer network of green veins. Leaves may appear mottled or speckled.

**Correction Measures:**

*   **Foliar Spray:**
    *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) at 0.5-1 g/L of water.
    *   Spray 2-3 times at 10-15 day intervals.
*   **Soil Application:**
    *   Apply **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** at 10-20 kg/acre, mixed with FYM. This is more effective in acidic to neutral soils. For alkaline soils, foliar application is generally more efficient.
