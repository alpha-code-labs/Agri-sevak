As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) for the Haryana region. It is crucial to understand that macro-nutrient deficiencies can significantly impact the growth, yield, and quality of Jack Fruit.

**General Recommendation:**
Before applying any fertilizers, it is highly recommended to conduct a comprehensive soil test. This will provide precise information about the nutrient status of your soil and help in formulating an accurate and efficient fertilization plan, preventing over-application or under-application of nutrients.

Here's how to address deficiencies of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K):

### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, chlorophyll production, and overall plant vigor.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   General yellowing (chlorosis) of older leaves, starting from the tips and margins, progressing inwards.
    *   Stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and sparse foliage.
    *   Pale green appearance of the entire plant.
    *   Reduced fruit set and smaller fruit size.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For a mature bearing tree (5-10 years old), apply 200-300 g of **Urea** (46% N) or 400-600 g of **Ammonium Sulphate** (20.5% N) or 300-500 g of **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate** (25% N) per tree. This dose should be split into 2-3 applications during the active growing season (e.g., pre-monsoon and post-monsoon). Apply the fertilizer evenly around the root zone and lightly incorporate it into the soil, followed by irrigation.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):** Dissolve 10-15 g of **Urea** per litre of water (1-1.5% solution) and spray thoroughly on the foliage. Repeat the application after 10-15 days if symptoms persist.

### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is essential for root development, flowering, fruiting, and energy transfer within the plant.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Dark green or purplish discoloration of older leaves, especially on the underside.
    *   Stunted growth and poor root development.
    *   Delayed flowering and fruit maturity.
    *   Reduced fruit set and poor fruit quality.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For a mature bearing tree, apply 500-750 g of **Single Superphosphate** (16% P2O5) or 200-300 g of **Di-ammonium Phosphate** (46% P2O5, 18% N) per tree. This should ideally be applied once annually, preferably before the monsoon or during early growth stages. Incorporate the fertilizer into the soil around the root zone.

### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium plays a crucial role in water regulation, nutrient transport, fruit development, and disease resistance.

*   **Symptoms:**
    *   Scorching or browning of leaf margins (necrosis) on older leaves, often starting from the tips.
    *   Weak stems and branches, leading to lodging.
    *   Poor fruit development, reduced fruit size, and quality.
    *   Increased susceptibility to diseases and pests.

*   **Corrective Measures:**
    *   **Soil Application:** For a mature bearing tree, apply 200-300 g of **Potassium Chloride** (Muriate of Potash, 60% K2O) or **Potassium Sulphate** (Sulphate of Potash, 50% K2O) per tree. This dose can be split into 2 applications during the growing season. Apply around the root zone and irrigate.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick relief):** Dissolve 10-15 g of **Potassium Sulphate** per litre of water (1-1.5% solution) and spray thoroughly on the foliage. Repeat after 10-15 days if necessary.

### General Recommendations for Nutrient Management:

*   **Soil Testing:** Reiterate the importance of regular soil testing (every 2-3 years) to monitor nutrient levels and adjust fertilization programs accordingly.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg per mature tree annually) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Ensure a balanced supply of all essential nutrients, as an excess of one nutrient can sometimes induce the deficiency of another.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as water is essential for nutrient uptake by the roots.
*   **Timing:** Apply fertilizers at appropriate times, usually during active growth periods or before flowering/fruiting, to maximize their effectiveness.

For precise recommendations tailored to your specific farm conditions and tree age, it is always advisable to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University or your local agricultural extension office.
