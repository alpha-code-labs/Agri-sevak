As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhopper, Whitefly, Thrips, and Psylla) in Jack Fruit. This approach combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable and effective pest management.

**1. Monitoring and Early Detection:**
Regularly inspect your jackfruit trees, especially new flushes and the undersides of leaves, for the presence of pests or symptoms like curling leaves, honeydew, sooty mould, or stunted growth. Early detection is crucial for effective control.

**2. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds, as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can lead to lush, succulent growth that is highly attractive to sucking pests. Maintain balanced nutrition.
*   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy severely infested leaves or shoots, especially during early infestation.
*   **Water Jet Spray:** For small infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge aphids and whiteflies from the leaves.
*   **Reflective Mulches:** Using silver-colored reflective mulches around young trees can deter some flying pests like whiteflies and thrips.

**3. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage natural predators like ladybird beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Biopesticides:** Consider using formulations of entomopathogenic fungi like *Beauveria bassiana* or *Verticillium lecanii* during periods of high humidity, which can be effective against various sucking pests.

**4. Chemical Control (Use only CIBRC approved chemicals, as a last resort and in rotation):**
When pest populations are high and other methods are insufficient, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

*   **For general sucking pests (Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla):**
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL: Apply at 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP: Apply at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Spirotetramat** 150 OD: Apply at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water. (Effective against whiteflies, mealybugs, aphids, and thrips).
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG: Apply at 0.3 g/L of water. (Specifically effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC: Apply at 1.25 ml/L of water. (Primarily targets whitefly nymphs and hoppers).
    *   **Azadirachtin** 1500 ppm (or higher concentration like 10000 ppm): Apply at 2.5-5.0 ml/L of water. (A botanical insecticide with repellent and anti-feedant properties, suitable for early infestations and as part of an IPM strategy).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the label instructions for dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) specified for each chemical to ensure the safety of the fruit.
*   Spray during the cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Consult your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to the current pest situation and crop stage in your area.
