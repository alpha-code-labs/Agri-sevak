As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Haryana:

Jackfruit is a long-duration tree crop, and proper establishment is crucial for its long-term productivity. While seed propagation is possible, vegetative propagation methods are generally preferred for commercial cultivation to ensure true-to-type plants, early bearing, and uniform fruit quality.

### **1. Propagation Method and Sowing/Planting:**

#### **A. Seed Propagation (Primarily for Rootstock or Variable Progeny):**

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   **Nursery Raising (Recommended):** This method allows for better selection of vigorous seedlings and easier management.
        *   Prepare raised nursery beds (approximately 1 meter wide and of convenient length) with well-drained soil mixed with sand and well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM).
        *   Sow fresh, viable seeds in rows 15-20 cm apart, with 10-15 cm spacing within rows.
        *   Alternatively, sow one seed per polybag (e.g., 15 cm x 25 cm) filled with a suitable potting mix.
    *   **Direct Sowing:** While possible, it is less common for commercial orchards due to variability and delayed fruiting. If direct sowing, plant seeds directly into the prepared pits in the main field.
*   **Planting Depth (for seeds):** Sow seeds at a depth of **2-3 cm**.
*   **Seed Dose:**
    *   For nursery raising: Approximately **100-150 g** of fresh, viable seeds per square meter of nursery bed, or 1 seed per polybag.
    *   For direct sowing: Plant **2-3 seeds per pit** to ensure at least one healthy seedling establishes. Thin to the strongest single seedling after establishment.

#### **B. Vegetative Propagation (Preferred for Commercial Orchards):**

*   **Methods:** Budding (patch, forkert) and grafting (approach, soft wood) are common methods to produce true-to-type plants. These vegetatively propagated saplings are then planted in the main field.
*   **Planting Method/Pattern (for saplings):** Plant the nursery-raised seedlings or vegetatively propagated saplings into the pre-dug pits in the main field. Ensure the root ball remains intact during transplanting.
*   **Planting Depth (for saplings):** Plant the sapling so that the top of the root ball is level with the ground surface. The graft union (if applicable) should be **15-20 cm** above the soil level to prevent scion rooting.

### **2. Spacing:**

*   The recommended spacing for jackfruit trees depends on the variety's vigor, soil fertility, and management practices.
*   **Standard Spacing:** For most vigorous varieties, a spacing of **10 m x 10 m** (meter by meter) is generally recommended. This allows for adequate sunlight penetration, air circulation, and space for canopy development as trees mature.
*   **High-Density Planting (HDP):** For certain dwarf or semi-dwarf varieties, or with intensive pruning and management, HDP can be adopted with spacing like **8 m x 8 m** or even **7 m x 7 m**. This requires careful planning and regular pruning to manage canopy size.

### **3. Pit Preparation:**

*   Before planting, dig pits of **1 m x 1 m x 1 m** (length x width x depth) size.
*   Fill the pits with a mixture of topsoil, **20-25 kg** of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost, **1 kg** of neem cake, and **100 g** of superphosphate. Allow the pits to settle for a few weeks before planting, ideally during the monsoon season (July-August) or early spring (February-March).
