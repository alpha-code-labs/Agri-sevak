As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed and soil treatment processes for Jack Fruit, keeping in mind the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana and CIBRC approved practices.

Jack fruit is typically propagated through seeds for rootstock or directly for planting, as well as through vegetative methods like grafting or budding. The following recommendations are primarily for seed-based propagation and general soil health for young and established trees.

### Recommended Seed Treatment Process for Jack Fruit

Jack fruit seeds are recalcitrant and should be sown fresh. Seed treatment primarily aims to protect against seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens causing damping-off and early seedling diseases in the nursery stage.

*   **Fungal Protection:**
    *   Treat seeds with a systemic fungicide like **Carbendazim** at a rate of 1 gram per kilogram of seeds.
    *   Alternatively, use a contact fungicide like **Thiram** at a rate of 2 grams per kilogram of seeds.
    *   For biological control, treat seeds with *Trichoderma viride* formulation at a rate of 4 grams per kilogram of seeds.
    *   Ensure the chemical or biological agent is thoroughly mixed with the seeds before sowing to ensure uniform coating.

### Recommended Soil Treatment Process for Jack Fruit

Soil treatment for Jack Fruit focuses on preparing the planting site for new trees and managing soil-borne diseases and pests for established trees.

**1. Pre-plant Pit Treatment (for new plantings):**
This is crucial for establishing healthy trees and preventing early infections.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungi (e.g., root rot, collar rot, damping-off):**
    *   Before planting, drench the prepared planting pit with a fungicidal solution. Use **Carbendazim** at 1 gram per litre of water, or **Propiconazole** at 1 ml per litre of water. Apply 2-5 litres of this solution per pit, depending on the pit size.
    *   Alternatively, incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) enriched with *Trichoderma viride*. Mix 2.5 kg of *Trichoderma viride* formulation with 50 kg of FYM, allow it to decompose for 10-15 days, and then apply 250-500 grams of this enriched FYM per planting pit.
*   **For Nematodes (if a known problem in the area):**
    *   While chemical nematicides like **Carbofuran** (e.g., 10-20 grams per pit) can be used, their application is often restricted due to environmental concerns. It is advisable to prioritize biological and cultural methods.
    *   A safer and environmentally friendly approach is to incorporate neem cake (200-500 grams per pit) or a bio-nematicide like *Paecilomyces lilacinus* (20 grams per pit) into the soil during pit preparation. These help suppress nematode populations naturally.

**2. Ongoing Soil Health Management and Treatment for Established Trees:**

*   **General Soil Health:**
    *   Regularly incorporate organic matter such as well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost into the soil around the trees. This improves soil structure, water retention, nutrient availability, and enhances beneficial microbial activity, which naturally suppresses many soil-borne pathogens.
    *   Ensure proper drainage in the orchard to prevent waterlogging, which is a major predisposing factor for root rot and collar rot diseases.
*   **For Existing Soil-borne Diseases (e.g., root rot, collar rot):**
    *   If established trees show symptoms of root rot or collar rot, drench the soil around the base of the affected tree with a suitable fungicide.
    *   Use a combination fungicide like **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb** at 2.5 grams per litre of water, or **Propiconazole** at 1 ml per litre of water. Apply 5-10 litres of the solution per tree, depending on the tree size and severity of the infection. Repeat if necessary, following label instructions.

Always follow the specific instructions and safety precautions provided on the product labels for all chemical and biological treatments. Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, are recommended for sustainable Jack Fruit cultivation.
