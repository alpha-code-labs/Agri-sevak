As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice regarding the control of these pests in Jack Fruit.

### Control of Fruit Fly in Jack Fruit

Fruit flies (primarily *Bactrocera dorsalis* and related species) are a significant pest of jackfruit, causing damage by laying eggs in the developing fruits, leading to maggot infestation and fruit rot. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, damaged, and infested fruits. Bury them deep in the soil or dispose of them properly to break the pest life cycle.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** After harvest, deep ploughing around the trees can expose pupae in the soil to predators and adverse weather conditions.
*   **Bagging of Fruits:** For smaller fruits or in home gardens, individual fruit bagging with paper or cloth bags can prevent fruit fly oviposition.
*   **Pheromone Traps:** Install Methyl Eugenol traps at a density of 10-12 traps per acre, starting from fruit set. These traps attract and kill male fruit flies, reducing the population. Replace the lure every 2-3 weeks.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only if cultural and mechanical methods are insufficient and infestation is severe):**

*   **Poison Bait Sprays:** This is a highly effective and targeted method for fruit fly control.
    *   Prepare a bait solution by mixing **Malathion 50% EC** at 2 ml/L of water with 20 g/L of jaggery (gur) or 5 g/L of protein hydrolysate.
    *   Apply this bait solution as spot sprays on the foliage (not directly on the fruits, especially close to harvest) on 10-15% of the trees, preferably in the morning hours. Repeat every 7-10 days if needed.
*   **Foliar Sprays (if infestation is very high):**
    *   Spray with **Spinosad 45% SC** at 0.25 ml/L of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Deltamethrin 2.8% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
    *   Ensure thorough coverage of the canopy. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) for any chemical applied.

### Control of Ber Fly in Jack Fruit

This is not known to affect Jack Fruit. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a highly host-specific pest primarily affecting Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*) and other *Ziziphus* species. It does not infest Jack Fruit (*Artocarpus heterophyllus*).
