As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for the ideal transplantation of Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Haryana:

Jack Fruit is a tropical to subtropical fruit tree that can be successfully grown in parts of Haryana with proper management, especially in areas with assured irrigation and protection from severe frost during winter for young plants.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

The most suitable time for transplanting Jack Fruit saplings in Haryana is during the monsoon season.

*   **Monsoon Season (July-August):** This period provides ample natural moisture, which is crucial for the establishment of young plants and reduces the need for frequent irrigation initially. It also allows the plant to establish before the onset of the harsh winter.
*   **Alternatively, Late Winter/Early Spring (February-March):** If assured irrigation facilities are available, planting can also be done during this period, allowing the plant to establish before the peak summer heat. However, monsoon planting is generally preferred for better success rates.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

Jack Fruit trees grow large with a wide canopy, requiring adequate spacing for optimal growth, light penetration, air circulation, and ease of management.

*   **Standard Spacing:** 8 meters x 8 meters (26 feet x 26 feet) to 10 meters x 10 meters (33 feet x 33 feet) between plants and rows.
*   For commercial orchards, a spacing of **10 m x 10 m** is often recommended to allow for full canopy development and long-term productivity.

### Transplantation Process

The success of transplantation largely depends on meticulous preparation and careful handling of the saplings.

1.  **Pit Preparation:**
    *   Dig pits of **1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter** (length x width x depth) at the marked spacing.
    *   Dig these pits at least 15-30 days before planting to allow them to weather and expose the soil to sunlight, which helps in pest and disease control.
    *   Separate the topsoil from the subsoil.

2.  **Soil Amendment:**
    *   Mix the excavated topsoil with well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg), neem cake (1-2 kg), and **Single Super Phosphate** (500 g - 1 kg) per pit. This mixture provides essential nutrients and improves soil structure.
    *   Refill the pits with this enriched soil mixture, forming a slight mound above ground level to account for settling.

3.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, 1-2 year old grafted or budded saplings from a reputable nursery. Grafted plants are preferred as they bear fruit earlier and ensure true-to-type fruit quality.
    *   Ensure the root ball is intact and the plant shows vigorous growth.

4.  **Planting the Sapling:**
    *   On the day of planting, make a small hole in the center of the refilled pit, large enough to accommodate the root ball of the sapling.
    *   Carefully remove the sapling from its polybag or container without disturbing the root ball.
    *   Place the sapling in the center of the hole, ensuring that the graft union (the point where the scion was joined to the rootstock) remains 10-15 cm above the soil level.
    *   Fill the remaining space with the prepared soil mixture, gently firming the soil around the root ball to remove any air pockets.
    *   Create a small basin or ring around the plant for efficient irrigation.

5.  **Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Watering:** Immediately after planting, water the sapling thoroughly until the soil is saturated. Continue regular watering, especially during dry periods, to ensure proper establishment.
    *   **Staking:** Provide a sturdy stake (e.g., bamboo or wooden stick) to support the young plant and protect it from strong winds. Tie the plant loosely to the stake.
    *   **Mulching:** Apply a layer of organic mulch (e.g., straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plant (but not touching the stem) to conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and suppress weed growth.
    *   **Protection:** Protect young plants from direct harsh sunlight, strong winds, and browsing animals (cattle, goats) by erecting temporary shade structures or fencing if necessary.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a successful establishment of Jack Fruit plants in Haryana, leading to healthy growth and future productivity.
