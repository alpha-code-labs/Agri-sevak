Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I am pleased to provide scientifically verified advice to enhance the yield, fruit quality, and storage life of Jack Fruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Haryana.

Jackfruit cultivation, while not as widespread as some other fruits in Haryana, can be highly rewarding with proper management. Here's a comprehensive approach:

---

### I. Improving Yield

To maximize the number and size of fruits per tree, focus on optimal tree health and resource allocation:

1.  **Nutrient Management:** Jackfruit is a heavy feeder. Regular and balanced fertilization is crucial.
    *   **Macro-nutrients (N, P, K):** Apply farmyard manure (FYM) or compost annually (25-50 kg/tree for mature trees). Supplement with chemical fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for mature bearing trees (10+ years) is 500-1000 g Nitrogen, 250-500 g Phosphorus, and 500-1000 g Potassium per tree per year, applied in two split doses (pre-monsoon and post-monsoon).
    *   **Micro-nutrients:** Deficiencies can severely impact fruit set and development.
        *   **Boron:** Critical for flowering and fruit set. Apply **Borax** at 100-200 g per tree annually to the soil, or foliar spray with **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** at 1-1.5 g/L water during flowering.
        *   **Zinc:** Important for overall plant vigor and fruit development. Apply **Zinc sulphate heptahydrate** at 200-300 g per tree to the soil, or foliar spray with **Chelated Zinc** at 0.5-1 g/L water before flowering and during fruit development.

2.  **Irrigation:** Consistent moisture is vital, especially during flowering and fruit development stages.
    *   Provide regular irrigation during dry spells, particularly from February to June. Water stress during these periods can lead to flower drop and poor fruit development.
    *   Drip irrigation is highly recommended for efficient water use.

3.  **Pruning:**
    *   Remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches to improve light penetration and air circulation within the canopy.
    *   Light pruning after harvest can encourage new growth and better fruit bearing in the subsequent season.

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:** A healthy tree is a productive tree. Regularly monitor for common pests (e.g., fruit borer, mealybugs) and diseases (e.g., fruit rot, stem rot) and take timely, integrated pest management (IPM) measures.

### II. Improving Fruit Quality

To ensure large, well-formed, and palatable fruits, focus on specific cultural practices:

1.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   **Potassium (K):** Adequate Potassium is crucial for fruit size, sugar content, and overall fruit quality. Ensure sufficient K application as mentioned above.
    *   **Boron:** Prevents internal browning and ensures proper fruit shape. Maintain adequate Boron levels as described under yield improvement.

2.  **Irrigation:** Consistent water supply prevents fruit cracking and ensures uniform development, leading to better size and texture.

3.  **Fruit Thinning:**
    *   Jackfruit trees often set a large number of fruits. Thinning excess fruits, especially malformed or small ones, allows the remaining fruits to grow larger and develop better quality.
    *   Aim for 1-2 healthy fruits per fruiting spur, or a manageable number per branch, depending on tree vigor. This should be done when fruits are small (e.g., 10-15 cm long).

4.  **Pest and Disease Management:** Timely control of pests and diseases prevents blemishes, internal damage, and premature fruit drop, ensuring aesthetically pleasing and healthy fruits.

5.  **Harvesting at Optimal Maturity:** Harvesting at the correct stage of maturity is paramount for taste, aroma, and texture.
    *   Indicators include a dull, yellowish-green skin color, a characteristic aroma, and a hollow sound when tapped.

### III. Improving Storage Life

Extending the shelf life of jackfruit requires careful post-harvest handling and appropriate treatments:

1.  **Harvesting at Optimal Maturity:** As mentioned, harvesting at the right stage is critical. Under-ripe fruits will not ripen properly, and over-ripe fruits will spoil quickly.

2.  **Careful Handling:**
    *   Jackfruits are susceptible to physical damage. Harvest fruits carefully, avoiding dropping or bruising.
    *   Use sharp tools to cut the fruit stalk, leaving a small portion attached to the fruit.
    *   Transport fruits gently to minimize damage.

3.  **Pre-cooling:**
    *   Rapidly remove field heat after harvest. This can be done by placing fruits in a cool, shaded area or using forced-air cooling if facilities are available.

4.  **Post-harvest Treatments:**
    *   **Fungicidal Dips:** To prevent post-harvest rots, which are a major cause of spoilage.
        *   Dip fruits in a solution of **Carbendazim** (0.5-1 g/L water) or **Thiophanate-methyl** (0.5-1 g/L water) or **Prochloraz** (0.5-1 ml/L water) for 5-10 minutes immediately after harvest. Allow to air dry.
    *   **Edible Coatings/Waxing:** Applying an edible coating or food-grade wax can reduce moisture loss and respiration rate, thereby extending shelf life. These coatings create a semi-permeable barrier.

5.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store jackfruits in a cool, well-ventilated place.
    *   Optimal storage temperature for mature green jackfruits is typically 11-13°C with 85-90% relative humidity, which can extend shelf life for 2-4 weeks. However, for ripening, higher temperatures (20-25°C) are needed.
