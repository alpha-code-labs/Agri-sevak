As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and micronutrients in Jack Fruit cultivation in Haryana:

1.  **Ethephon (for fruit ripening)**
    *   **Purpose:** To promote uniform and early ripening of mature jackfruit.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For post-harvest ripening, spray or dip mature green jackfruits in a solution of **Ethephon** at a concentration of 100-250 ppm (parts per million).
        *   **Practical Application (for Ethephon 39% SL formulation):** Mix 0.25 - 0.65 ml of **Ethephon** 39% SL per litre of water.
    *   **Method:** Spray the solution uniformly on the fruits or dip the fruits in the solution for a few minutes. Ensure proper ventilation during ripening.

2.  **2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)**
    *   **Recommendation:** While **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is a synthetic auxin, its use as a growth regulator for jackfruit in Haryana is not a standard or widely recommended practice. Its primary agricultural use is as a herbicide, and application as a growth regulator requires extremely precise concentrations to avoid phytotoxicity and adverse effects on the crop. Therefore, its use for jackfruit is generally not advised without specific, research-backed recommendations for the region, which are currently not established for general application in jackfruit in Haryana.

3.  **Boron (as a micronutrient)**
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, and overall fruit development. Deficiency can lead to poor fruit set, fruit malformation, and cracking.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** For foliar application to correct boron deficiency and improve fruit set:
        *   Spray with a solution of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** (Borax) at 0.1% - 0.2% concentration.
        *   **Practical Application:** Dissolve 1 - 2 grams of **Disodium tetraborate decahydrate** per litre of water.
    *   **Method:** Apply as a foliar spray, typically before flowering and again after fruit set, ensuring thorough coverage of the foliage. Soil application rates depend on soil test results and are generally higher.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the product label.
*   Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during application.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for accurate dosage.
*   For any specific concerns or severe deficiencies, it is advisable to conduct a soil and leaf analysis to determine precise nutrient requirements.
