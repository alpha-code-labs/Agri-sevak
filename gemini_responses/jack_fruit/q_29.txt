Regarding 'Tinda/Boll dropping' in Jack Fruit, this terminology is not applicable to Jack Fruit. 'Tinda' refers to a type of gourd, and 'Boll' refers to the fruit capsule of cotton. Jack Fruit produces flowers and fruits, and the primary concern would be flower drop and fruit drop.

Flower and fruit drop in Jack Fruit is often a physiological response to various factors, including nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, and environmental stresses. Here's a scientifically verified approach to control flower and fruit drop in Jack Fruit:

**1. Nutritional Management:**
Ensure adequate and balanced nutrition, especially micronutrients crucial for flowering and fruit set.

*   **Boron:** Essential for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fruit set.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1-1.5 g/L of water. Spray twice: once at the pre-flowering stage and again at the early fruit set stage (when fruits are pea-sized).
    *   **Soil Application:** Based on soil test recommendations, apply 10-15 kg/acre of **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate) annually, preferably before the flowering season.
*   **Zinc:** Important for auxin synthesis and overall plant vigor, which indirectly affects fruit retention.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Spray **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** at 3-5 g/L of water, along with 2.5 g/L of **Calcium Hydroxide** (slaked lime) to neutralize acidity. Apply at pre-flowering and early fruit set stages.
*   **Potassium:** Plays a vital role in fruit development and stress tolerance.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Potassium Nitrate** at 5-10 g/L of water during the fruit development stages to support fruit growth and retention.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** Conduct a soil test to determine the exact nutrient requirements. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can promote vegetative growth at the expense of reproductive growth, leading to increased drop.

**2. Hormonal Regulation (Plant Growth Regulators - PGRs):**
Plant Growth Regulators can help in reducing physiological drop.

*   **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA):** This auxin is effective in reducing flower and fruit drop.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** at a concentration of 10-20 mg/L (ppm) of water. The first spray should be given when fruits are at the pea-size stage, and a second spray can be applied 15-20 days later if necessary.

**3. Water Management:**
Maintain consistent soil moisture, as both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit drop.

*   **Irrigation:** Provide regular and adequate irrigation, especially during the critical stages of flowering and fruit development. Avoid extreme fluctuations in soil moisture.

**4. Cultural Practices:**

*   **Pollination:** Ensure good pollinator activity (wind and insects) as inadequate pollination can lead to unfertilized flowers dropping.
*   **Pruning:** Practice judicious pruning to remove dead, diseased, or overcrowded branches. This improves air circulation and light penetration, contributing to overall tree health and vigor.
*   **Pest and Disease Control:** Timely identification and management of any pest or disease infestations that might weaken the tree and contribute to premature dropping of flowers and fruits.

**Important Note:** Always conduct a soil test before applying major nutrients to ensure precise and efficient nutrient management. For chemical applications, strictly follow the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines.
