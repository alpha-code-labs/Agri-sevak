As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following doses for organic manures for Jackfruit cultivation in Haryana, keeping in mind the long-term health and productivity of the trees:

It is crucial to conduct a soil test to get precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions. The following are general guidelines:

### Recommended Doses of Organic Manures for Jackfruit

**1. Farmyard Manure (FYM)**

**FYM** is an excellent source of organic matter and essential nutrients, improving soil structure and water retention.
*   **Young Trees (1-3 years old):** 10-20 kg per tree per year.
*   **Growing Trees (4-7 years old):** 25-40 kg per tree per year.
*   **Bearing Trees (8 years and older):** 50-75 kg per tree per year.
    *   *Application:* Apply **FYM** in two split doses, once before the monsoon (June-July) and once after the harvest (October-November), spread evenly around the tree basin and lightly incorporated into the soil.

**2. Vermicompost**

**Vermicompost** is richer in nutrients and beneficial microbes compared to FYM.
*   **Young Trees (1-3 years old):** 2-5 kg per tree per year.
*   **Growing Trees (4-7 years old):** 5-10 kg per tree per year.
*   **Bearing Trees (8 years and older):** 10-15 kg per tree per year.
    *   *Application:* Similar to **FYM**, apply in two split doses before monsoon and after harvest, spread around the tree basin and lightly incorporated.

**3. Sagarika (Seaweed Extract)**

**Sagarika** is a biostimulant derived from seaweed, known to enhance nutrient uptake, root development, and overall plant vigour. It complements bulk organic manures.
*   **Foliar Application (Liquid Sagarika):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply 2-3 sprays during critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and fruit development. Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
*   **Soil Application (Liquid Sagarika as drench):**
    *   **Dose:** 5-10 ml per litre of water, applying 5-10 litres of solution per tree.
    *   **Timing:** Apply around the root zone during active growth periods, especially after transplanting or during periods of stress.
*   **Granular Application (If using Sagarika G or similar granular form):**
    *   **Dose:** 50-100 g per tree.
    *   **Timing:** Apply twice a year, once before monsoon and once after harvest, mixed into the soil around the tree basin.

**General Recommendations for Organic Manure Application:**

*   **Timing:** The best time to apply bulk organic manures like **FYM** and **Vermicompost** is during the pre-monsoon period (May-June) and post-harvest (October-November) to allow for decomposition and nutrient release.
*   **Method:** Spread the manure evenly in the tree basin, extending to the drip line, and lightly incorporate it into the topsoil. Avoid piling it directly against the tree trunk.
*   **Watering:** Always irrigate the trees thoroughly after applying organic manures to help nutrients leach into the root zone.
