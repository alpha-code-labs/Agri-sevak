As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

### Scab (Interpreted as Fungal Leaf Spots/Scorch)

While "scab" is not a primary disease term for strawberries, symptoms resembling scab can be caused by common fungal leaf spot diseases such as Leaf Scorch (*Diplocarpon earlianum*) and Leaf Spot (*Mycosphaerella fragariae*). Control measures for these are as follows:

**Integrated Disease Management:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Use Certified Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always start with healthy, certified runners or plants.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to promote good air circulation, which helps reduce leaf wetness and fungal growth.
    *   **Irrigation Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Drip irrigation is preferred to keep foliage dry. If overhead irrigation is necessary, do it in the morning to allow leaves to dry quickly.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy infected leaves, plant debris, and weeds from the field to reduce inoculum sources.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.

2.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively or at the first sign of disease, rotating different modes of action to prevent resistance development.
    *   **Mancozeb**: Apply 2.0-2.5 kg/acre.
    *   **Captan**: Apply 1.5-2.0 kg/acre.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride**: Apply 2.0-2.5 kg/acre.
    *   **Azoxystrobin**: Apply 200-300 ml/acre.
    *   **Tebuconazole**: Apply 250-375 ml/acre.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin**: Apply 200-300 ml/acre (often available in combination products).

### Canker

This is not known to affect Strawberry. Canker is typically a disease of woody plants, not herbaceous strawberry plants.

### Gummosis

This is not known to affect Strawberry. Gummosis is the exudation of gum from tree bark, primarily seen in stone fruit and citrus trees.

### Lichen

This is not known to affect Strawberry. Lichens are symbiotic organisms that grow on surfaces like tree bark, rocks, or soil. They are not parasitic and do not harm strawberry plants. Their presence indicates good air quality and they are not considered a pest or disease of strawberry.
