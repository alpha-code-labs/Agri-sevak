As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

### Seed Treatment for Strawberry

Commercial strawberry cultivation primarily relies on vegetative propagation using runners, crowns, or tissue culture plants, rather than seeds. Seed propagation is generally used for breeding new varieties. Therefore, a standard "seed treatment" process in the conventional sense (as applied to cereals or pulses) is **not applicable or recommended for commercial strawberry planting.**

### Soil Treatment Process for Strawberry

Pre-planting soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, pests, and weeds, ensuring a healthy start for strawberry plants.

**1. Soil Solarization (Recommended Non-Chemical Method):**
This is a highly effective and environmentally friendly method, particularly suitable for Haryana's climate.
*   **Process:** After preparing the land and ensuring it is moist, cover the entire planting area with a transparent (clear) polyethylene sheet (25-100 micron thick). Ensure the edges are buried in the soil to trap heat effectively.
*   **Timing:** Conduct during the hottest months (e.g., May-June) for 4-6 weeks.
*   **Benefits:** The trapped solar heat raises soil temperatures to levels lethal for many soil-borne pathogens (fungi like *Fusarium*, *Verticillium*, *Phytophthora*), nematodes, and weed seeds.

**2. Biological Soil Treatment (Recommended for enhancing soil health and disease suppression):**
These beneficial microbes can be incorporated into the soil 15-20 days before planting.
*   **For Fungal Disease Suppression and Plant Growth Promotion:**
    *   **Trichoderma viride** (or **Trichoderma harzianum**) 1% WP: Apply 2.5 kg/acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed Farmyard Manure (FYM) or compost and broadcast evenly over the soil, then lightly incorporate.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens** 1% WP: Apply 2.5 kg/acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and broadcast evenly over the soil, then lightly incorporate.
*   **For Nematode Management (if nematodes are a known problem):**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) 1% WP: Apply 2.5 kg/acre. Mix with 50-100 kg of well-decomposed FYM or compost and broadcast evenly over the soil, then lightly incorporate before planting.

**3. Chemical Soil Treatment (Use only if specific severe problems are identified and biological/solarization methods are insufficient):**
Always follow label instructions carefully and ensure proper safety measures.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., *Phytophthora* crown and root rot, *Fusarium* wilt, *Verticillium* wilt):**
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: As a pre-plant soil drench, apply 2-3 ml/L of water. Ensure thorough wetting of the soil where plants will be placed.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: As a pre-plant soil drench, apply 1-1.5 g/L of water. This is effective against a broad spectrum of soil-borne fungi.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting to understand nutrient status and identify potential pest/disease issues.
*   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural practices (like crop rotation, sanitation), biological methods, and judicious use of chemicals for sustainable management.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can exacerbate many soil-borne diseases.
