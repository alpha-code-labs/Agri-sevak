As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of Growth Regulators/Hormones and micronutrients in Strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

### **1. Ethrel (Ethephon)**

**Ethrel** is a plant growth regulator that releases ethylene, influencing various physiological processes in strawberries.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Runner Suppression:** To divert plant energy from runner production towards fruit development, thereby increasing yield.
    *   **Flower Induction:** To promote early and uniform flowering, potentially leading to earlier fruit set and harvest.
*   **Recommended Dose and Application:**
    *   **For Runner Suppression:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **2.5-5 ml/L** of water. Begin application after the first flush of runners appears (typically 4-6 weeks after planting) and repeat 2-3 times at 15-day intervals. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **For Flower Induction:** Apply **Ethephon** (39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **1.5-2.5 ml/L** of water, approximately 2-3 weeks before the anticipated flowering period. This can help in synchronizing flowering and improving fruit set.
*   **Caution:** High doses or late applications of Ethephon, especially close to harvest, can lead to premature fruit softening and reduced shelf life. Always follow recommended doses and timings.

### **2. 2,4-D**

2,4-D is a synthetic auxin primarily known and registered for its use as a broadleaf herbicide.

*   **Recommendation:** 2,4-D is a potent herbicide and its use as a growth regulator in strawberry is generally **not recommended** for commercial cultivation. Even at extremely low concentrations, there is a high risk of phytotoxicity, causing deformities, reduced growth, and significant crop damage to strawberries. There are no scientifically verified and safe recommendations for its use as a growth regulator in strawberry in Haryana.

### **3. Boron**

Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for various physiological functions in strawberries, particularly for reproductive development.

*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Improved Pollen Viability and Germination:** Essential for successful pollination and fertilization.
    *   **Enhanced Fruit Set:** Prevents flower drop and promotes better fruit development.
    *   **Prevention of Fruit Deformities:** Boron deficiency can lead to small, misshapen, or poorly developed fruits.
    *   **Overall Plant Health:** Contributes to cell wall formation and sugar transport.
*   **Recommended Dose and Application:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Apply **Boron** (as Sodium tetraborate decahydrate, e.g., Borax, containing approximately 11.3% elemental Boron) at a concentration of **1-2 g/L** of water (0.1-0.2% solution).
        *   **Timing:** Start application at the pre-flowering stage and repeat 2-3 times at 15-20 day intervals during the flowering and early fruiting period. Ensure complete coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Soil Application (for severe deficiency):** If soil tests indicate severe Boron deficiency, **Boron** (as Sodium tetraborate decahydrate) can be applied at **8-10 kg/acre** before planting or as a side-dressing. However, foliar application is generally more efficient for quick correction and precise nutrient delivery in strawberries.
*   **Caution:** While essential, excessive Boron can be toxic to plants. Always conduct a soil test to determine existing Boron levels and apply only as needed.
