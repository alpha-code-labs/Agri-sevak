As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling sucking pests in strawberry, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips can cause significant damage to strawberry plants by feeding on sap, leading to stunted growth, distorted leaves and fruits, transmission of viral diseases, and promotion of sooty mold due to honeydew excretion.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Sucking Pests in Strawberry:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Weed Management:** Remove weeds in and around the strawberry beds as they can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
    *   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing for good air circulation, which can reduce pest build-up.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, as it can lead to lush, soft growth that is more attractive to sucking pests.
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infested plant parts to prevent further spread.
    *   **Mulching:** Use reflective mulches (e.g., silver-colored plastic) which can deter some flying insects like aphids and whiteflies.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which prey on aphids and whiteflies. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves and new growth, for the presence of pests. Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor populations of whiteflies, leafhoppers, and winged aphids.

4.  **Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved for Haryana):**
    When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance. Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.

    **For general control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, and Whiteflies:**

    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at 0.5 - 0.75 ml per litre of water. Effective against aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 g per litre of water. Provides good control of aphids, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
    *   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Effective against a wide range of sucking pests including aphids and whiteflies.
    *   **Pymetrozine 50% WG:** Apply at 0.3 - 0.4 g per litre of water. Specific for aphids and whiteflies, acts as a feeding deterrent.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at 0.75 - 1 ml per litre of water. A systemic insecticide effective against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.

    **For Thrips specific control (often require targeted approach):**

    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at 1.5 - 2 ml per litre of water. Effective against thrips and also provides control of other sucking pests.
    *   **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** Apply at 1 g per litre of water. Effective against thrips, whiteflies, and mites.

    **For Whitefly nymphs (Insect Growth Regulator):**

    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at 1.25 ml per litre of water. Primarily targets whitefly nymphs by inhibiting chitin synthesis.

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval mentioned on the product label to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
    *   **Spray Volume:** Ensure adequate spray volume to achieve thorough coverage of the foliage.
    *   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.
    *   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to be a common or significant pest of Strawberry in Haryana or generally. If psyllid-like symptoms are observed, the general insecticides recommended for aphids and whiteflies would likely be effective.

Always consult the latest recommendations from Haryana Agricultural University or your local agricultural extension office for specific product availability and updated guidelines. Read and follow all instructions on the pesticide label carefully.
