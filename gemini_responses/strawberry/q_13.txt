As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

**Ber Fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*)**
This is not known to affect Strawberry. The Ber fly (*Carpomyia vesuviana*) is a specific pest of Ber (*Ziziphus mauritiana*).

**Fruit Fly (e.g., *Drosophila* species, particularly Spotted Wing Drosophila - *Drosophila suzukii*)**
Fruit flies, especially *Drosophila* species, can be a significant pest of strawberries, causing direct damage to ripening and ripe fruits. Control strategies should focus on an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach:

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy all fallen, overripe, or infested fruits from the field. This is crucial to break the pest's life cycle and reduce breeding sites.
*   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest fruits as soon as they ripen to prevent them from becoming overripe and more attractive to fruit flies.
*   **Physical Barriers:** In small-scale cultivation, covering plants with fine mesh netting (e.g., insect-proof nets) can physically exclude fruit flies.
*   **Bait Traps:** Use fruit fly traps with attractants like protein hydrolysate or specific pheromones (if available for the target *Drosophila* species) to monitor pest populations and mass trap adults.

**2. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and with strict adherence to safety guidelines and pre-harvest intervals):**
For effective control of fruit flies in strawberries, especially *Drosophila* species, consider the following CIBRC approved technical chemicals. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure fruit safety.

*   **Spinosad** (e.g., 45% SC formulation):
    *   Dosage: 0.25 - 0.3 ml per litre of water.
    *   Apply as a foliar spray, ensuring good coverage, especially on ripening fruits. Spinosad has a relatively short pre-harvest interval, making it suitable for fruit crops.

*   **Malathion** (e.g., 50% EC formulation):
    *   Dosage for bait spray: 2 ml per litre of water, mixed with 10-20 g of jaggery or molasses per litre.
    *   Apply as spot sprays on foliage or on bait stations. Malathion can also be used as a general spray at 1.5-2 ml/L, but bait sprays are often more targeted for fruit flies.

*   **Cyantraniliprole** (e.g., 10.26% OD formulation):
    *   Dosage: 1.8 ml per litre of water.
    *   Apply as a foliar spray. This insecticide offers good control against a range of pests, including some fruit flies, and has a favorable safety profile.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Rotate Insecticides:** To prevent the development of insecticide resistance, rotate between different classes of insecticides.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check and strictly adhere to the PHI mentioned on the insecticide label before harvesting fruits to ensure they are safe for consumption.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Chemical control should always be a part of an integrated pest management strategy, complementing cultural and mechanical methods for sustainable pest control.
