Here are the recommended doses for Organic Manures (FYM, Vermicompost, and Sagarika) in Strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **15-20 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before transplanting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to provide a steady release of nutrients and improve soil structure.
*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **3-5 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, or as a top-dressing around the plants during active growth. Vermicompost provides readily available nutrients and beneficial microbes.
*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   Sagarika is a biostimulant derived from seaweed, not a bulk organic manure. It enhances nutrient uptake, promotes root development, and improves overall plant vigour and fruit quality.
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Mix **2.5-5 ml of Sagarika per litre of water** and spray uniformly on the foliage. Apply at critical growth stages such as vegetative growth, pre-flowering, and fruit development. Repeat every 15-20 days as needed.
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Application:** Apply **500 ml to 1 litre of Sagarika per acre**, diluted in sufficient water, through drip irrigation or as a soil drench around the plants. This can be done during active growth phases to stimulate root growth and nutrient absorption.
