As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I advise an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved fungicides for effective management of various rot types in strawberry. All the rot types you mentioned are known to affect strawberry.

**General Principles for Rot Management in Strawberry:**

1.  **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.
    *   Prepare raised beds (30-45 cm high) to improve drainage and aeration around roots and crowns.
    *   Conduct soil solarization during hot summer months (May-June) for 4-6 weeks to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
    *   Ensure optimal soil pH (5.5-6.5) and nutrient balance.

2.  **Planting Material:**
    *   Always use certified, disease-free runners from reputable nurseries. This is crucial to prevent the introduction of pathogens like *Phytophthora* and *Colletotrichum*.

3.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing wetting of foliage, flowers, and fruits.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting, as it creates a humid environment conducive to fungal growth.
    *   Irrigate in the morning to allow plants to dry quickly.
    *   Avoid over-irrigation and waterlogging, which are primary causes of root and crown rots.

4.  **Mulching:**
    *   Use plastic mulch (black or silver) or straw mulch to prevent direct contact of fruits with soil, reducing the incidence of fruit rots. Mulch also helps in weed control and moisture retention.

5.  **Plant Spacing and Air Circulation:**
    *   Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which helps in quick drying of foliage and reduces humidity.
    *   Remove old, diseased, or senescent leaves regularly.

6.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Regularly scout the field and promptly remove and destroy any diseased plants, fruits, or plant debris. Do not compost infected material.
    *   Clean tools and equipment to prevent pathogen spread.

7.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, soft growth more susceptible to diseases.

**Specific Control Measures for Rot Types:**

The various rot types often share common causal organisms and management strategies. We can group them for effective control.

**A. Root, Stem, Foot, Collar, Crown, and Neck Rots (Primarily caused by *Phytophthora*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Pythium* species):**
These rots affect the underground parts and the base of the plant, leading to wilting, stunting, and plant death.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Implement all general principles mentioned above, especially excellent drainage, raised beds, and use of disease-free planting material.
    *   Avoid planting in fields with a history of severe rot problems.

*   **Chemical Control (Drenching/Soil Application):**
    *   **For *Phytophthora* species (Root, Crown, Collar, Foot Rot):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: Apply as a drench at 2.5-3 ml/L water around the base of plants, especially after transplanting or at the first sign of disease.
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP: Drench at 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** 31.8% WP (Metalaxyl-M 4% + Mancozeb 64%): Drench at 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **For *Rhizoctonia*, *Fusarium*, *Pythium* species (Root, Stem, Foot Rot):**
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: Drench at 1.5-2 g/L water.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Drench at 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: (Also effective against *Pythium*) Drench at 2.5-3 ml/L water.

**B. Fruit Rots (Black Rot, Grey Mould, Anthracnose, Leather Rot, Rhizopus Rot):**
These rots affect the developing and mature fruits, causing significant yield losses.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use mulch to keep fruits off the soil.
    *   Ensure good air circulation by proper plant spacing and timely removal of old leaves.
    *   Harvest fruits regularly and remove any diseased or overripe fruits from the field.
    *   Handle fruits carefully during harvest to avoid injury, which can be entry points for pathogens.
    *   Avoid overhead irrigation during flowering and fruiting.

*   **Chemical Control (Foliar Spray):**
    *   **For Grey Mould (*Botrytis cinerea*):**
        *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** 55% WG (Pyraclostrobin 5% + Metiram 50%): Spray at 1.5-2 g/L water, starting from flowering.
        *   **Boscalid + Pyraclostrobin** 38% WG (Boscalid 25.2% + Pyraclostrobin 12.8%): Spray at 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Fenhexamid** 50% WG: Spray at 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Cyprodinil + Fludioxonil** 62.5% WG (Cyprodinil 37.5% + Fludioxonil 25%): Spray at 0.6-0.8 g/L water.
    *   **For Anthracnose (*Colletotrichum acutatum*) and Black Rot (can be *Alternaria* or *Colletotrichum*):**
        *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Spray at 0.5-1 ml/L water.
        *   **Pyraclostrobin + Metiram** 55% WG: Spray at 1.5-2 g/L water.
        *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: Spray at 1-1.5 g/L water.
        *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP: Spray at 2-2.5 g/L water (broad-spectrum protective).
    *   **For Leather Rot (*Phytophthora cactorum*):**
        *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP: Spray at 2.5-3 g/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** 31.8% WP: Spray at 2-2.5 g/L water.

**C. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot (Damping-off):**
These affect seeds before germination or young seedlings, causing them to rot or collapse.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Use sterilized potting mix or growing media for seed germination.
    *   Ensure proper sowing depth and spacing.
    *   Maintain optimal moisture levels; avoid overwatering.
    *   Provide good ventilation to seedlings.

*   **Chemical Control (Seed Treatment/Drench):**
    *   **Seed Treatment:**
        *   **Thiram** 75% WS: Treat seeds at 2-3 g/kg seed before sowing.
        *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Treat seeds at 1-2 g/kg seed.
    *   **Drenching (for seedlings):**
        *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: Drench the seedling trays/beds at 2-2.5 ml/L water.
        *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** 31.8% WP: Drench at 2 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Fungicide Rotation:** Always rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly adhere to the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) mentioned on the fungicide label to ensure food safety.
*   **Label Instructions:** Always read and follow the specific instructions, dosage, and safety precautions provided on the product label.
*   **Integrated Disease Management (IDM):** The most sustainable and effective control relies on an IDM approach, combining all suitable methods.

By implementing these scientifically verified practices, you can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of rot diseases in your strawberry crop in Haryana.
