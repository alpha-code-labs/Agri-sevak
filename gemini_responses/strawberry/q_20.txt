Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I understand the critical importance of balanced nutrition for successful strawberry cultivation. Micronutrient deficiencies, if not addressed promptly and correctly, can severely impact yield and fruit quality.

Before any application, it is crucial to conduct a soil test and, if possible, a leaf tissue analysis from our HAU labs. Visual symptoms can be indicative, but precise diagnosis ensures effective and economical nutrient management.

Here's how to address common micronutrient deficiencies in strawberries:

### 1. Zinc (Zn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted plant growth, small and narrow leaves (often called "little leaf"), interveinal chlorosis (yellowing between veins) on younger leaves, and sometimes a rosetted appearance.
*   **Recommended Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** For quick correction, spray with:
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zn) @ 0.5-1.0 kg/acre in 200 litres of water.
        *   OR **Zinc EDTA** (12% Zn) @ 100-200 g/acre in 200 litres of water.
    *   **Soil Application:** If soil test indicates severe deficiency:
        *   **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate** (33% Zn) @ 5-10 kg/acre, broadcast and incorporated into the soil before planting or as a side-dressing.

### 2. Iron (Fe) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Pronounced interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, where the veins remain distinctly green while the tissue between them turns yellow. In severe cases, the entire leaf may turn pale yellow or even white.
*   **Recommended Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Foliar sprays are generally most effective for iron deficiency, especially in high pH soils where soil-applied iron becomes unavailable. Spray with:
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) @ 0.5-1.0 kg/acre in 200 litres of water.
        *   OR **Ferrous EDTA** (12% Fe) @ 100-200 g/acre in 200 litres of water.

### 3. Boron (B) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, distorted or thickened young leaves, short internodes, poor flower and fruit set, and malformed or cracked fruits (often leading to "buttoning" or "cat-facing" in strawberries). Terminal buds may die.
*   **Recommended Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** Boron is best applied as a foliar spray for quick uptake:
        *   **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% B) @ 100-200 g/acre in 200 litres of water.
        *   OR **Borax** (Sodium Tetraborate Decahydrate, 10.5-11.3% B) @ 200-400 g/acre in 200 litres of water.
    *   **Soil Application:** Use with extreme caution as boron can be toxic in excess:
        *   **Borax** (10.5-11.3% B) @ 1-2 kg/acre, only if soil test confirms severe deficiency and pH is suitable.

### 4. Calcium (Ca) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Young leaves may be distorted, stunted, or curled. Growing points (meristems) can die back. Fruits may show poor firmness and reduced shelf life. Tip burn on young leaves or runners can also be a symptom.
*   **Recommended Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:** For immediate correction and improved fruit quality:
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca) @ 1.0-2.0 kg/acre in 200 litres of water.
        *   OR **Calcium Chloride** (27% Ca) @ 0.5-1.0 kg/acre in 200 litres of water.
    *   **Soil Application:** To improve overall soil calcium levels:
        *   **Gypsum** (Calcium Sulphate Dihydrate, 23% Ca) @ 200-500 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil, especially beneficial in sodic soils.
        *   **Calcium Nitrate** (18.8% Ca) can also be applied through fertigation @ 10-20 kg/acre.

### 5. Magnesium (Mg) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on older leaves, where the tissue between the veins turns yellow while the veins remain green. Leaves may become brittle or develop a reddish-purple tint in severe cases.
*   **Recommended Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (Epsom Salt, 9.6% Mg) @ 1.0-2.0 kg/acre in 200 litres of water.
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Magnesium Sulphate Heptahydrate** (9.6% Mg) @ 10-20 kg/acre, broadcast or through fertigation.

### 6. Manganese (Mn) Deficiency

*   **Symptoms:** Interveinal chlorosis on young leaves, often appearing as a mottled or speckled yellowing, similar to iron deficiency but typically less severe and more diffuse. Growth may be stunted.
*   **Recommended Correction:**
    *   **Foliar Application:**
        *   **Manganese Sulphate Monohydrate** (30.5% Mn) @ 0.5-1.0 kg/acre in 200 litres of water.
        *   OR **Manganese EDTA** (12% Mn) @ 100-200 g/acre in 200 litres of water.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Accurate Diagnosis:** Always prioritize soil and leaf tissue analysis to confirm deficiencies and avoid unnecessary or excessive applications, which can lead to toxicity.
*   **Timing:** Apply micronutrients during active growth phases, typically before flowering and during fruit development, for best results.
*   **Water Quality:** Use clean water for all foliar sprays.
*   **Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility when mixing micronutrient solutions with other pesticides or fertilizers.
*   **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Incorporate organic matter into the soil, maintain optimal soil pH (5.5-6.5 for strawberries), and ensure balanced application of NPK fertilizers to enhance micronutrient availability and uptake.
