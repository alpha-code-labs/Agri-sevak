Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies in strawberries, which are crucial for healthy plant growth and fruit production in Haryana.

It is important to note that visual symptoms are indicators, but a soil test is the most accurate way to determine nutrient status and precise fertilizer requirements.

### Addressing Macro-nutrient Deficiencies in Strawberry

#### 1. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Nitrogen is vital for vegetative growth, leaf development, and chlorophyll production, which is essential for photosynthesis.
*   **Symptoms:** Older leaves turn pale green to yellow (chlorosis), growth is stunted, and plants appear weak.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:** Apply nitrogenous fertilizers in split doses during the growing season.
        *   **Urea** (46% N): 10-15 kg/acre, applied in 2-3 splits, ensuring proper irrigation after application.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   **Urea** (0.5-1% solution): Dissolve 5-10 g of **Urea** per litre of water. Spray during cooler parts of the day, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat every 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

#### 2. Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Phosphorus is crucial for root development, flowering, fruit set, energy transfer, and overall plant vigor.
*   **Symptoms:** Leaves, especially older ones, may develop a purplish tint on the underside. Growth is severely stunted, and flowering and fruiting are poor.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application (Basal or early growth stage):** Phosphorus is less mobile in soil, so it's best applied before or at planting.
        *   **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): 25-30 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil before planting or as a side-dressing.
        *   **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5): 100-120 kg/acre, incorporated into the soil before planting.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction, though less effective than soil application for P):**
        *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP)** (12% N, 61% P2O5): Dissolve 5 g of **Monoammonium Phosphate** per litre of water.
        *   **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (0-52-34): Dissolve 5 g of **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** per litre of water. Spray during cooler parts of the day.

#### 3. Potassium (K) Deficiency

*   **Role:** Potassium is essential for fruit quality (size, sweetness, shelf life), water regulation, disease resistance, and overall plant metabolism.
*   **Symptoms:** Leaf margins (edges) of older leaves turn yellow, then brown and scorched (necrosis). Fruits may be small, soft, and have poor flavour.
*   **Correction:**
    *   **Soil Application:**
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): 15-20 kg/acre, applied in split doses during the growing season.
        *   **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** (50% K2O, 17.5% S): 18-24 kg/acre. SOP is often preferred for strawberries as they can be sensitive to chloride present in MOP.
    *   **Foliar Spray (for quick correction):**
        *   **Potassium Nitrate** (13% N, 45% K2O): Dissolve 5-10 g of **Potassium Nitrate** per litre of water.
        *   **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** (0-52-34): Dissolve 5 g of **Potassium Dihydrogen Phosphate** per litre of water. Spray during cooler parts of the day, ensuring good leaf coverage. Repeat every 7-10 days if symptoms persist.

### General Recommendations:

*   **Soil Testing:** Always conduct a soil test before planting and periodically thereafter. This provides precise recommendations for nutrient application, preventing both deficiencies and excesses. HAU provides excellent soil testing facilities.
*   **Balanced Fertilization:** While addressing specific deficiencies, ensure a balanced nutrient program to prevent other deficiencies from emerging.
*   **Irrigation:** Proper and consistent irrigation is crucial for nutrient uptake by the roots. Ensure the soil is adequately moist but not waterlogged.
*   **Application Timing:** For soil applications, split doses are generally more effective, especially for nitrogen and potassium, to minimize leaching losses and ensure continuous nutrient availability.
*   **Foliar Spray Best Practices:** When applying foliar sprays, use a good quality spreader/sticker to improve absorption and coverage. Avoid spraying during hot, sunny conditions to prevent leaf burn.
