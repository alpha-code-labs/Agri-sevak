Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon,

The symptom of "drying up" in strawberry plants, affecting branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, is a general indication of severe stress. It is crucial to accurately diagnose the underlying cause, as it can stem from various abiotic (environmental/cultural) or biotic (disease/pest) factors. As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise a systematic approach to identify and address the problem.

Here are the potential causes and their management strategies:

**I. Abiotic Factors (Environmental and Cultural Stress)**

These are often the primary culprits for widespread drying symptoms.

1.  **Water Stress:**
    *   **Under-watering:** Insufficient moisture leads to wilting and desiccation.
    *   **Over-watering/Poor Drainage:** Excess water suffocates roots, leading to root rot (even without pathogens), impairing water and nutrient uptake, causing symptoms similar to drought.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Implement drip irrigation for precise water delivery.
        *   Ensure well-drained soil. Amend heavy soils with organic matter (e.g., well-rotted farmyard manure) to improve drainage and aeration.
        *   Plant on raised beds to prevent waterlogging.
        *   Monitor soil moisture regularly; irrigate when the top 2-3 cm of soil feels dry.

2.  **Temperature Extremes:**
    *   **Heat Stress:** High temperatures (especially above 30°C) can cause wilting, scorching of leaves, and drying of flowers and fruits.
    *   **Frost Damage:** Freezing temperatures can cause water in plant cells to crystallize, leading to cell damage, blackening, and drying of plant parts.
    *   **Management:**
        *   For heat stress: Use shade nets (30-50% shade) during peak summer months. Maintain adequate soil moisture.
        *   For frost protection: Use row covers (non-woven fabric), irrigate before frost (water releases latent heat), or use overhead sprinklers (if feasible and managed correctly).

3.  **Nutrient Imbalance:**
    *   **Deficiencies:** Severe deficiencies of essential nutrients (e.g., Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Boron) can lead to poor plant health, wilting, and drying of leaf margins or entire leaves.
    *   **Toxicities:** High soil salinity or excessive application of certain fertilizers can cause root damage and desiccation.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Conduct soil testing to determine nutrient status and pH.
        *   Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
        *   Use organic amendments to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
        *   For salinity issues, leach salts with good quality water and improve drainage.

4.  **Soil Compaction/Poor Aeration:**
    *   Compact soil restricts root growth and oxygen availability, leading to poor water and nutrient uptake, and ultimately drying symptoms.
    *   **Management:**
        *   Prepare soil thoroughly before planting, incorporating organic matter.
        *   Avoid heavy machinery movement in the field.

**II. Biotic Factors (Diseases and Pests)**

If abiotic factors are ruled out, consider biotic causes.

1.  **Fungal Diseases:**
    *   **Root and Crown Rots (e.g., *Phytophthora cactorum*, *Rhizoctonia solani*, *Fusarium oxysporum*, *Verticillium dahliae*):** These are major causes of wilting and drying of entire plants.
        *   **Symptoms:** Sudden wilting of leaves, stunting, reddish-brown discoloration or necrosis of the crown (when cut open), and rotting of roots.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Cultural:** Use certified disease-free planting material. Ensure excellent drainage. Avoid planting in fields with a history of these diseases. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately.
            *   **Chemical (Soil Drench/Drip Application):**
                *   For *Phytophthora* species:
                    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2.5 ml/L of water.
                    *   **Metalaxyl** 35% WS at 2 g/kg seed treatment (for nursery plants) or **Metalaxyl-M** 4% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2.5 g/L as a drench.
                *   For *Fusarium*, *Rhizoctonia*, *Verticillium*:
                    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 g/L of water.
                    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP at 1-1.5 g/L of water.
                    *   *Apply as a drench around the base of affected plants.*

    *   **Anthracnose (Crown Rot Phase) (*Colletotrichum acutatum*):**
        *   **Symptoms:** Dark, sunken lesions on stolons, petioles, and crowns, leading to wilting, collapse, and drying of the plant.
        *   **Management:**
            *   **Cultural:** Use disease-free plants. Remove and destroy infected plant debris. Avoid overhead irrigation.
            *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
                *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC at 0.5-1 ml/L of water.
                *   **Pyraclostrobin** 20% WG at 0.75 g/L of water.
                *   **Mancozeb** 75% WP at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
                *   **Captan** 50% WP at 2-2.5 g/L of water.
                *   *Rotate fungicides to prevent resistance.*

2.  **Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot Nematodes - *Meloidogyne* spp.):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, wilting, yellowing, and drying of leaves, especially during hot periods. Examination of roots will reveal characteristic galls or swellings.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Practice crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., marigold, cereals). Use resistant varieties if available. Solarize soil during summer months before planting.
        *   **Biological:** Apply bio-nematicides containing *Paecilomyces lilacinus* or *Purpureocillium lilacinum* to the soil at planting or as a drench.

3.  **Pests (Less common for whole-plant drying, but can contribute):**
    *   **Two-spotted Spider Mites (*Tetranychus urticae*):** Severe infestations cause bronzing, stippling, and eventual drying of leaves.
    *   **Thrips (*Frankliniella occidentalis*, *Scirtothrips dorsalis*):** Feed on flowers and young fruits, causing browning, distortion, and drying.
    *   **Management:**
        *   **Cultural:** Maintain good field sanitation. Use strong water sprays to dislodge mites.
        *   **Chemical (Foliar Spray):**
            *   For Mites:
                *   **Spiromesifen** 22.9% SC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   **Fenpropathrin** 30% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
            *   For Thrips:
                *   **Fipronil** 5% SC at 1.5-2 ml/L of water.
                *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5 ml/L of water.
                *   *Always ensure thorough coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves.*

**III. Diagnostic Steps:**

1.  **Examine the entire plant:** Look for specific symptoms on leaves, stems, crown, and roots.
2.  **Check the soil:** Assess moisture levels, drainage, and any unusual odors (indicating root rot).
3.  **Inspect the crown:** Carefully cut open the crown of an affected plant to check for discoloration or rot.
4.  **Examine roots:** Gently dig up a plant and wash the roots to check for galls (nematodes), discoloration, or decay.
5.  **Consider recent history:** Recall recent weather patterns, irrigation practices, and any chemical applications.
6.  **Laboratory Analysis:** If unsure, collect samples (whole plant, soil) and send them to the Plant Pathology or Entomology laboratories at HAU, Hisar, for accurate diagnosis.

**IV. General Management Principles:**

*   **Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant material and weeds.
*   **Certified Planting Material:** Always use healthy, certified, disease-free strawberry runners.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid continuous cultivation of strawberries in the same field.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Provide adequate and balanced nutrients based on soil tests.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid both water stress and waterlogging.

By carefully observing the symptoms and following these guidelines, you should be able to identify the cause of drying up in your strawberry plants and implement effective management strategies.
