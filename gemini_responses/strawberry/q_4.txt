Wilt, including Parawilt, is a significant concern in strawberry cultivation in Haryana, often leading to substantial yield losses. It can be caused by various factors, primarily soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Verticillium dahliae* (Verticillium wilt), *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *fragariae* (Fusarium wilt), and *Phytophthora cactorum* (Phytophthora crown rot/wilt). Parawilt is often a complex condition, sometimes associated with environmental stress (heat, waterlogging, nutrient deficiencies) or mild root damage, which can mimic or exacerbate pathogenic wilts.

Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods.

**1. Cultural Practices (Foundation of Wilt Management):**

*   **Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always use certified, disease-free runners or plants from reputable nurseries. This is the most critical step to prevent introduction of pathogens.
*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Choose well-drained fields. Avoid areas with a history of wilt diseases.
    *   Improve soil drainage by incorporating organic matter and creating raised beds.
    *   Ensure proper soil pH (5.5-6.5) and balanced nutrition to promote strong plant growth and resilience.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting strawberries in fields where solanaceous crops (like tomato, potato, brinjal) or other susceptible crops have been grown in the last 3-5 years, as they can host *Verticillium*. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In hot summer months, covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets for 4-6 weeks can significantly reduce soil-borne pathogen populations, including wilt fungi.
*   **Water Management:** Avoid overwatering, which can create anaerobic conditions favorable for *Phytophthora* and stress roots, making them susceptible. Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone.
*   **Weed Control:** Weeds can act as alternate hosts for pathogens and compete for nutrients.
*   **Sanitation:** Promptly remove and destroy any wilted or diseased plants to prevent the spread of pathogens. Disinfect tools after working with infected plants.

**2. Biological Control:**

*   **Bio-fungicides:** Application of beneficial microbial antagonists can help suppress soil-borne pathogens.
    *   **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum**: Apply as a soil drench or mix with farmyard manure (FYM) before planting.
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50-100 kg FYM, applied at the time of planting or as a drench around established plants.

**3. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Chemical control should be used judiciously and as part of an integrated strategy, especially for confirmed pathogenic wilts. Soil drenching is the most effective method for soil-borne diseases.

*   **For Fusarium and Verticillium Wilt (if suspected):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Drench the soil around the base of the plants with a solution of 1-2 g/L water. Repeat after 15-20 days if symptoms persist.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl** 70% WP: Drench the soil around the base of the plants with a solution of 1-1.5 g/L water. Repeat after 15-20 days if necessary.

*   **For Phytophthora Crown Rot/Wilt (if suspected, characterized by sudden collapse, reddish-brown discoloration in crown):**
    *   **Propamocarb Hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: Drench the soil around the base of the plants with a solution of 2-3 ml/L water.
    *   **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: Drench the soil around the base of the plants with a solution of 2-2.5 g/L water.
    *   **Fosetyl-Al** 80% WP: Drench the soil around the base of the plants with a solution of 2-3 g/L water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific cause of wilt is crucial for effective management. If possible, send samples to a diagnostic lab at HAU for confirmation.
*   **Timing:** Apply fungicides preventively if there's a history of wilt, or at the first sign of symptoms.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of fungicides to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   **Safety:** Always follow label instructions for dosage, application, pre-harvest interval (PHI), and safety precautions. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

By implementing these measures, strawberry growers in Haryana can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of wilt diseases and ensure healthy, productive crops.
