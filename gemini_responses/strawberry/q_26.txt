As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified information on specialized practices for strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

### Specialized Practices in Strawberry Cultivation

**1. Pruning**
Strawberries are herbaceous plants, and traditional "pruning" as applied to woody plants is not practiced. However, specific cultural practices are undertaken that serve a similar purpose:

*   **Runner Removal:** Strawberries produce stolons known as runners, which are vegetative propagules. For commercial fruit production, especially in annual plasticulture systems common in Haryana, runners should be regularly removed. This directs the plant's energy towards fruit development rather than vegetative growth, leading to larger and higher-quality fruits. Runner removal should be done every 1-2 weeks during the growing season. If new plants are desired for propagation, a limited number of runners can be allowed to root.
*   **Old Leaf Removal:** Periodically, especially after the main fruiting season or during the renovation phase (if plants are kept for a second year), old, diseased, or damaged leaves can be removed. This improves air circulation within the canopy, reduces the incidence of foliar diseases, and encourages the growth of new, healthy leaves.

**2. Desuckering**
This term is not applicable to strawberries. Strawberries produce runners (stolons) from the mother plant, not suckers in the botanical sense (which typically arise from the base or roots of plants like banana or sugarcane). The practice of removing these runners is covered under "Pruning - Runner Removal."

**3. Mulching**
Mulching is a crucial practice for successful strawberry cultivation in Haryana, offering multiple benefits:

*   **Weed Control:** Mulch acts as a physical barrier, suppressing weed growth and reducing competition for water and nutrients.
*   **Moisture Retention:** It reduces evaporation from the soil surface, conserving soil moisture and reducing irrigation frequency.
*   **Soil Temperature Regulation:** Black plastic mulch, commonly used, helps warm the soil during cooler months, promoting early plant growth and fruit development. It also helps stabilize soil temperature. Organic mulches can help keep the soil cooler during hot periods.
*   **Fruit Cleanliness:** Mulch prevents direct contact of fruits with the soil, keeping them clean and reducing the risk of soil-borne diseases and rot.
*   **Disease Reduction:** It minimizes soil splash onto leaves and fruits during irrigation or rain, thereby reducing the spread of soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Types of Mulch:**
    *   **Plastic Mulch (Polythene Mulch):** Black plastic mulch (typically 25-30 micron thickness) is widely used in Haryana. It is laid on raised beds before planting, and planting holes are made through it.
    *   **Organic Mulches:** Materials like wheat straw, rice straw, or pine needles can be applied around the base of the plants after establishment. Straw is particularly effective in keeping fruits clean, hence the name "strawberry."

**4. Grafting**
This is not known to affect Strawberry. Grafting is not a standard or practical propagation method for strawberries. Strawberries are typically propagated vegetatively through runners (stolons), by crown division, or sexually by seeds. Therefore, grafting is not a relevant practice for strawberry cultivation.

**5. Pollination**
Strawberries are generally self-fertile, meaning a single flower can produce fruit without pollen from another plant or flower. However, effective pollination is vital for maximizing fruit size, achieving uniform fruit shape, and increasing overall yield.

*   **Role of Insects:** While self-fertile, insect pollination (primarily by honey bees and other wild bees) significantly enhances fruit quality. Bees facilitate the transfer of pollen within the flower and between flowers, ensuring better fertilization of the numerous ovules present on the strawberry receptacle.
*   **Benefits of Insect Pollination:**
    *   Increases the percentage of fruit set.
    *   Leads to larger, more uniformly shaped fruits.
    *   Reduces the incidence of malformed or "button" berries, which result from incomplete pollination.
*   **Recommendations for Haryana:**
    *   Encourage natural pollinators by minimizing the use of broad-spectrum insecticides, especially during the flowering period.
    *   For commercial cultivation, consider placing bee hives (e.g., 2-3 hives per acre) near strawberry fields during the flowering stage to ensure optimal pollination and maximize yield and quality.
