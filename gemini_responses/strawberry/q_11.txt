Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Strawberry cultivation in Haryana. These pests can cause significant damage if not managed effectively.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Approach:**

A holistic IPM approach is crucial for sustainable and effective pest control.

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Regularly remove weeds and plant debris from around strawberry beds, as these can harbor pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** While strawberries are perennial, rotating the location of new plantings can help reduce soil-borne pest populations.
    *   **Proper Nutrition and Irrigation:** Healthy, vigorous plants are more resilient to pest attacks.
    *   **Mulching:** Use of straw mulch can deter some soil-dwelling pests and also helps in weed control.
    *   **Hand Picking:** For small infestations, especially of larger beetles or sawfly larvae, hand-picking can be effective.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   **Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like predatory beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides when possible.
    *   **Nematodes:** For soil-dwelling larvae of root weevils, entomopathogenic nematodes (e.g., *Heterorhabditis bacteriophora* or *Steinernema carpocapsae*) can be applied as a soil drench.

3.  **Monitoring and Scouting:**
    *   Regularly inspect your strawberry plants for signs of pest activity (e.g., chewed leaves, clipped buds, presence of larvae or adults). Early detection is key to effective control.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved Technical Chemicals for Strawberry in India):**

When pest populations reach economic threshold levels, chemical intervention may be necessary. Always follow label instructions and observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

**For Beetles (e.g., Strawberry Bud Weevil/Clipper Weevil, Flea Beetles, Sap Beetles) and Weevils (e.g., Strawberry Root Weevil):**

*   **Timing:** For Strawberry Bud Weevil, apply insecticides before flowering when buds are visible but not yet open, to prevent clipping. For other beetles/weevils, apply upon observing significant feeding damage or adult presence.
*   **Recommended Chemicals:**
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 - 90 ml per acre).
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** (For early stages and IPM) Apply at 2 - 3 ml per litre of water.

**For Sawflies (e.g., Strawberry Sawfly):**

*   **Timing:** Apply when young larvae are observed skeletonizing leaves.
*   **Recommended Chemicals:**
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at 0.2 - 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 - 90 ml per acre).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at 0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (or 200 - 400 ml per acre).
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm:** (For early stages and IPM) Apply at 2 - 3 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough coverage of the plant foliage, especially the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the label for the specific PHI of the chosen chemical to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit.
*   **Safety:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application.

For specific local recommendations and the most up-to-date CIBRC approvals, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or the Department of Agriculture, Haryana.
