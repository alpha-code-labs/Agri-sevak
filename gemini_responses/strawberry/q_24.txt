Namaste Kisan Bhaiyon, as a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I am pleased to provide you with the scientifically verified recommendations for strawberry transplantation in Haryana.

### Ideal Transplantation Time

*   The optimal period for transplanting strawberry runners in Haryana is from **late September to mid-October**.
*   This timing allows the plants to establish a strong root system before the onset of severe winter and ensures robust vegetative growth, leading to good fruit production in late winter and early spring.

### Ideal Transplantation Distance

*   For commercial cultivation and ease of management, a spaced plant system is generally recommended.
*   **Row-to-row distance:** 75 cm
*   **Plant-to-plant distance:** 30 cm
*   This spacing facilitates proper air circulation, sunlight penetration, and efficient cultural operations like weeding, fertilizing, and harvesting.

### Ideal Transplantation Process

1.  **Land Preparation:**
    *   Deep plough the field to a depth of 25-30 cm, followed by 2-3 harrowings to achieve a fine tilth.
    *   Incorporate well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost at a rate of 20-25 tonnes per acre during land preparation.
    *   Form raised beds of about 15-20 cm height and 60 cm width, with 45 cm wide furrows between them. This improves drainage and aeration.
2.  **Selection of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free runners (bare-root or potted plants) obtained from a certified nursery.
    *   Ensure the plants have a well-developed root system.
3.  **Planting Technique:**
    *   Dig holes at the recommended spacing on the raised beds.
    *   Carefully place the strawberry plant in the hole, ensuring that the **crown (the point where the roots meet the stem) is exactly at the soil surface**.
    *   **Crucially, do not plant too deep** (which can smother the crown and lead to rot) **or too shallow** (which can expose the roots to drying out).
    *   Spread the roots evenly in the hole.
    *   Backfill with soil and gently firm around the plant to remove air pockets.
4.  **Immediate Post-Planting Care:**
    *   **Water immediately** after transplanting to settle the soil around the roots.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during the establishment phase.
    *   Consider applying a layer of straw mulch or using black plastic mulch after planting. This helps in moisture retention, weed suppression, and keeps the fruits clean.
    *   For the first 2-3 weeks, it is advisable to **remove any flowers** that appear. This encourages the plant to put its energy into root and vegetative growth, leading to a stronger plant and better future yields.
