Greetings. As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

### Grasshopper Control in Strawberry

Grasshoppers can feed on strawberry leaves and fruits, especially in young plants. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies are recommended.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Keep the area around the strawberry beds free of weeds and tall grasses, which can harbor grasshoppers.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion 50% EC**: Apply at 1.0 - 1.5 litres per acre, diluted in 500-750 litres of water. Ensure thorough coverage. Always observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) as per the product label (typically 7 days).
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Apply at 200-300 ml per acre, diluted in 200-400 litres of water. Observe the PHI as per the product label (typically 5-7 days).
    *   **Azadirachtin 1500 ppm (Neem oil based formulation)**: For early stages or light infestations, apply at 2.5 - 5.0 ml per litre of water. This is a biological option with minimal environmental impact and no PHI concerns.

### Painted Bug Control in Strawberry

This is not known to affect Strawberry. Painted bugs (Bagrada hilaris) are primarily pests of cruciferous crops like mustard, cabbage, and radish.

### Red Cotton Bug Control in Strawberry

This is not known to affect Strawberry. Red cotton bugs (Dysdercus cingulatus) are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants, feeding on developing seeds.

### Black Ants Control in Strawberry

Black ants are often attracted to the sweet, ripe strawberry fruits and can cause direct damage or protect sap-sucking insects (like aphids) for their honeydew.

*   **Cultural Practices:** Maintain good field sanitation by promptly removing ripe, overripe, or damaged fruits from the beds.
*   **Chemical Control (Targeted Application):**
    *   **Fipronil 0.01% GR (Granules)**: Apply granules around the base of the plants or along ant trails, not directly on the fruits or foliage. Follow product label instructions for targeted application to avoid direct contact with the crop.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: For perimeter treatment or drenching ant nests/trails around the strawberry beds (not directly on the plants or fruits). Use at 2.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC**: Can be used as a perimeter spray around the field or on ant trails at 0.5 ml per litre of water. Avoid direct application on fruits.

Always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest intervals.
