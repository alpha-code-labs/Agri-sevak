Wild animals pose a significant threat to strawberry crops in Haryana, causing considerable damage to fruits and plants. An integrated approach combining physical barriers, deterrents, and cultural practices is most effective for protection.

Here are the methods to protect Strawberry from wild animals:

*   **Physical Exclusion Barriers:**
    *   **Fencing for Large Animals:** For animals like Nilgai (Blue Bull), Wild Boar, and stray cattle, a robust perimeter fence is crucial.
        *   Use strong materials such as barbed wire, chain-link, or woven wire mesh.
        *   The fence should be at least 1.5 to 2 meters high to prevent jumping.
        *   For burrowing animals like wild boar, consider burying the fence base 30-45 cm deep or creating an outward-facing apron of mesh wire at ground level.
        *   **Electric Fencing:** Where permissible and safe, a low-voltage electric fence can be highly effective against larger animals. Ensure proper installation and signage as per safety regulations.
    *   **Netting for Birds and Monkeys:**
        *   Overhead anti-bird netting is highly effective against birds and monkeys.
        *   Install a support structure (poles and wires) over the strawberry beds and drape the netting over it, ensuring it is taut and secured at the sides to prevent entry.
        *   The mesh size should be small enough to exclude target animals (e.g., 15-25 mm for birds) but large enough for light and air circulation.
    *   **Fencing for Rodents and Rabbits:**
        *   Install fine mesh wire fencing (e.g., chicken wire with mesh size 1-2 cm) around the strawberry beds.
        *   Ensure the fence is at least 60 cm high and buried 15-30 cm deep to prevent burrowing.

*   **Deterrents:**
    *   **Visual Deterrents:**
        *   Hang reflective tapes, old CDs, or shiny objects around the field. These can temporarily scare birds and some animals due to their movement and reflection.
        *   Scarecrows can be used, but animals often habituate to them quickly, so their position should be changed frequently.
    *   **Auditory Deterrents:**
        *   Noise-making devices such as gas guns (requires permits and careful use), crackers, or even loud music can deter animals temporarily. However, animals can habituate, and these methods can cause disturbance to nearby areas.
    *   **Human Presence:**
        *   Regular patrolling and monitoring of the fields, especially during dawn and dusk when many animals are most active, can deter some animals.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Keep the area around the strawberry beds free of weeds, tall grasses, and debris. This reduces potential hiding spots for rodents and other small animals.
    *   **Prompt Harvesting:** Harvest ripe strawberries regularly. Overripe or fallen fruits attract animals, so removing them promptly reduces the allure.
    *   **Habitat Modification:** If possible, remove or manage nearby vegetation that provides cover or food sources for problematic wild animals.

An integrated approach, combining strong physical barriers with appropriate deterrents and good cultural practices, offers the best long-term protection for your strawberry crop from wild animals.
