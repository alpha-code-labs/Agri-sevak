As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I advise the following scientifically verified strategies to protect your strawberry crop from environmental stresses prevalent in Haryana:

### Protection from Extreme Cold and Frost

Strawberry plants are susceptible to frost damage, especially during flowering and fruiting.

*   **Mulching:** Apply a 5-10 cm thick layer of organic mulch (e.g., wheat straw, paddy straw, dry leaves, sugarcane trash) around the base of the plants. This insulates the soil, protects the roots and crown from freezing, and helps retain soil warmth.
*   **Row Covers / Low Tunnels:** Use non-woven agro-textile fabric (spun-bonded polypropylene) or clear polyethylene sheets to create low tunnels over the strawberry beds. These covers trap heat, raise the temperature around the plants by several degrees, and protect them from direct frost. Ensure covers are removed or ventilated during warm daytime hours to prevent excessive heat buildup and humidity.
*   **Overhead Irrigation (Sprinkler Frost Protection):** This is a highly effective method. Start applying water through sprinklers when the air temperature drops to 1-2°C and continue uninterrupted until the temperature rises above 0°C and all ice has melted naturally from the plants after sunrise. The latent heat released as water freezes on the plant surface protects the plant tissues from freezing. Use a continuous application rate of 2-4 mm per hour. Intermittent application can cause more damage than no irrigation.
*   **Windbreaks:** Plant taller crops (e.g., mustard, wheat) or erect artificial barriers on the windward side of the strawberry field to reduce the chilling effect of cold winds.

### Protection from Heat (Loo) and Intense Sunlight

High temperatures and intense sunlight, especially during the "Loo" period, can cause scorching, reduced fruit set, and poor fruit quality.

*   **Shade Nets:** Install 30-50% green or black shade nets over the strawberry beds during periods of intense heat (typically from late March to May) or when temperatures consistently exceed 30°C. Shade nets reduce direct solar radiation, lower the ambient temperature around the plants, and minimize water stress.
*   **Mulching:** Maintain a thick layer of organic mulch (as described above) to keep the soil cool, reduce soil temperature fluctuations, and conserve soil moisture, which is crucial during hot periods.
*   **Drip Irrigation:** Ensure consistent and adequate soil moisture through drip irrigation. Frequent, light irrigation during hot periods helps cool the plants and prevents wilting. Avoid overhead irrigation during peak sunlight hours, as water droplets can act as lenses and intensify sun scorch on leaves.
*   **Windbreaks:** Establish windbreaks (natural or artificial) to mitigate the desiccating effect of hot, dry winds (Loo), which can lead to rapid transpiration and plant stress.
