As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified cultivation practices for Strawberry in Haryana:

**1. Sowing Method/Pattern:**
*   Commercial strawberry cultivation primarily relies on **vegetative propagation** rather than seeds. This ensures genetic purity, uniformity, and faster fruiting.
*   The most common planting materials are:
    *   **Runners (stolons):** Young plants developed from the mother plant.
    *   **Bare-root plants:** Dormant plants dug from nurseries.
    *   **Tissue-cultured plants:** Disease-free plants produced in laboratories.
*   **Pattern:** Strawberries are typically planted on **raised beds** (approximately 30-45 cm high and 60-90 cm wide at the top) to ensure excellent drainage, aeration, and ease of management (e.g., drip irrigation, mulching).
    *   Plants can be arranged in a **single row** or, more commonly for higher yields, a **double row** pattern on these raised beds. Staggered planting in a double row is often preferred.

**2. Planting Depth:**
*   Correct planting depth is critical for the establishment and long-term productivity of strawberry plants.
*   The **crown** (the central growing point from which leaves, flowers, and runners emerge) must be planted precisely at the **soil surface level**.
*   **Ensure:**
    *   All roots are covered with soil and spread outwards naturally.
    *   The top of the crown is not buried, as this can lead to rotting and poor growth.
    *   The crown is not too high, exposing roots to drying out and stress.

**3. Spacing:**
*   Spacing recommendations vary depending on the planting system (single or double row on beds) and the specific cultivar.
*   **For a double row system on raised beds (commonly adopted in Haryana for higher density):**
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing within a row:** 20-30 cm.
    *   **Row-to-row spacing on the same bed:** 30-45 cm (often staggered).
    *   **Bed-to-bed spacing (furrow width):** 60-90 cm (to allow for irrigation lines, inter-cultivation, and harvesting).
*   **For a single row system on raised beds:**
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing within the row:** 30-45 cm.
    *   **Bed-to-bed spacing:** 90-120 cm.

**4. Seed Dose:**
*   **This is not known to affect Strawberry.**
*   Commercial strawberry cultivation does **not use seeds** for planting. Seeds are primarily utilized in breeding programs to develop new varieties due to genetic variability and the longer time required for plants to fruit.
*   Instead of "seed dose," we refer to **plant density**. Based on the recommended spacing for a double row system on raised beds, you would typically require approximately **35,000 to 50,000 plants per acre** (depending on the exact spacing and bed dimensions).
