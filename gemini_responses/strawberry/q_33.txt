Dear Farmer,

Controlling weeds in strawberry cultivation is crucial for maximizing yield and fruit quality. An integrated approach combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC-approved herbicides is recommended. Manual weeding remains the most effective and safest method, especially during the early stages of crop growth and around fruiting.

Here's a guide for controlling the specified weeds in strawberry:

**General Weed Management Principles:**
*   **Field Preparation:** Ensure thorough land preparation to reduce initial weed load.
*   **Mulching:** Use straw or plastic mulch to suppress weed growth, conserve moisture, and keep fruits clean.
*   **Manual Weeding:** Regular hand weeding is highly effective, especially for removing weeds close to the strawberry plants.

**Herbicide Recommendations (Use with extreme caution and follow label instructions precisely):**

**1. Broadleaf Weeds (e.g., Bathu, Congress grass) and Narrowleaf Weeds (e.g., Phalaris minor):**

*   **Pre-Emergent Control (before weed emergence, after transplanting):**
    *   **Pendimethalin** (30% EC): Apply at 1.0-1.25 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 3.3-4.15 litres of 30% EC formulation) in 200-300 litres of water per acre, within 3 days of transplanting. Ensure uniform coverage. This provides control for a wide range of germinating broadleaf and narrowleaf weeds.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen** (23.5% EC): Apply at 0.235 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1 litre of 23.5% EC formulation) in 200-300 litres of water per acre, within 3 days of transplanting. This is effective against many broadleaf weeds and some grasses.

*   **Post-Emergent Control (for actively growing grassy weeds only):**
    *   **Fluazifop-P-butyl** (25% EC): For control of narrowleaf (grassy) weeds like Phalaris minor, apply at 0.25-0.5 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 1-2 litres of 25% EC formulation) in 200-300 litres of water per acre, when grassy weeds are at the 2-4 leaf stage. Ensure spray does not drift onto broadleaf weeds or strawberry foliage excessively.
    *   **Sethoxydim** (18% EC): For control of narrowleaf (grassy) weeds, apply at 0.36-0.54 kg active ingredient per acre (equivalent to 2-3 litres of 18% EC formulation) in 200-300 litres of water per acre, when grassy weeds are actively growing.

**2. Amarbail (Cuscuta spp. - Dodder):**

*   Amarbail is a parasitic weed. Chemical control is very challenging once it has attached to the host.
*   **Cultural Control is Primary:**
    *   Use clean, dodder-free planting material.
    *   Remove any infested strawberry plants or parts immediately and destroy them to prevent seed dispersal.
    *   Prevent dodder from flowering and setting seeds.
    *   **Pre-emergent control:** **Pendimethalin** (as mentioned above for general weeds) can offer some suppression of germinating dodder seeds if applied before their emergence.

**3. Orobanche (Broomrape):**

*   This is not known to affect Strawberry. Orobanche species are typically parasitic on other dicotyledonous crops like mustard, tomato, brinjal, and legumes, but strawberries are not a common host.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the label instructions of any herbicide before application.
*   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment for uniform application.
*   Apply herbicides when there is no wind to prevent drift.
*   Consider the growth stage of the strawberry crop and weeds for optimal efficacy and crop safety.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
