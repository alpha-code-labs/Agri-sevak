Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can confirm that both Scale insects and Mealybugs are significant sap-sucking pests that can severely affect strawberry cultivation in Haryana. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's how to control them:

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Scale Insects and Mealybugs in Strawberry:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your strawberry plants, especially the undersides of leaves, leaf axils, stems, and fruit calyx, for early signs of these pests. Look for sticky honeydew, sooty mold, or the pests themselves.
2.  **Cultural and Mechanical Control:**
    *   **Pruning:** Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves, stems, or plants to reduce pest populations.
    *   **Sanitation:** Keep the strawberry beds free of weeds and plant debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   **Water Spray:** For minor infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge mealybugs and scale crawlers.
    *   **Hand Picking:** For small-scale infestations, mealybugs can be removed manually using a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol.
3.  **Biological Control:** Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles (both adults and larvae), lacewings, and parasitic wasps. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that can harm these beneficial insects.
4.  **Chemical Control (as a last resort or for severe infestations):**
    When chemical intervention is necessary, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and ensure thorough coverage, especially targeting the undersides of leaves and hidden areas where these pests reside. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

    **Recommended CIBRC-approved technical chemicals:**

    *   **Horticultural Mineral Oil (HMO):**
        *   **Dosage:** 10-20 ml per litre of water (1-2% solution).
        *   **Application:** Apply as a thorough spray, ensuring complete coverage. HMO works by suffocating the pests. It is effective against all stages, especially scale crawlers and mealybug nymphs. Apply during cooler parts of the day.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:**
        *   **Dosage:** 2.5 ml per litre of water (or 1.25 litres per acre, assuming 500 litres of spray volume per acre).
        *   **Application:** This is an insect growth regulator, highly effective against nymphs of both scale insects and mealybugs by disrupting their molting process. Apply when young nymphs are active.
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.4 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre, assuming 500 litres of spray volume per acre).
        *   **Application:** This is a systemic insecticide that moves both upwards and downwards in the plant, providing excellent control of hidden pests like mealybugs and scales.
    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2-0.25 ml per litre of water (or 100-125 ml per acre, assuming 500 litres of spray volume per acre).
        *   **Application:** A systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sap-sucking pests. Apply as a foliar spray.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:**
        *   **Dosage:** 0.2 g per litre of water (or 100 g per acre, assuming 500 litres of spray volume per acre).
        *   **Application:** Another systemic insecticide effective against sap-sucking pests. Apply as a foliar spray.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Always check the specific product label for the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the safety of the harvested fruit. Adhere strictly to the recommended PHI.
*   **Spray Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves and in dense foliage, as these pests often hide in protected areas.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling and applying pesticides. Follow all safety instructions on the product label.
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your local conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with the agricultural extension office or HAU experts in your region.
