As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for managing the mentioned pests in strawberry cultivation in Haryana:

### Pest Management in Strawberry

**1. Borers:**
*   This is not known to affect Strawberry as a primary or widespread pest requiring specific chemical intervention in Haryana.

**2. Caterpillars (General leaf and fruit feeding caterpillars):**
*   Caterpillars, including armyworms, cutworms, fruitworms, and leafrollers, can cause significant damage to strawberry leaves, flowers, and developing fruits. An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach is highly recommended.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect plants for eggs, larvae, and feeding damage, especially on the underside of leaves and near developing fruits.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain field hygiene by removing weeds and crop debris, which can harbor pests.
    *   Hand-picking of larger caterpillars can be effective in small areas or for early infestations.
*   **Chemical Control (when pest population crosses economic threshold):**
    *   For effective control of various caterpillar species, consider the following CIBRC approved insecticides:
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 60-75 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. This provides excellent control against a broad spectrum of lepidopteran pests.
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 88-100 g per acre in 200-400 litres of water. It offers good control of various caterpillars with translaminar action.
        *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 200 ml per acre in 200-400 litres of water. It is effective against chewing pests.
    *   **Note:** Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and fruits. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development. Always strictly observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) to ensure fruit safety.

**3. Diamondback moth:**
*   This is not known to affect Strawberry. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard).

**4. Leaf folder:**
*   Leaf folders, often referring to leaf-rolling caterpillars, are a type of caterpillar that can affect strawberries by rolling or folding leaves and feeding inside. The control measures for general caterpillars, particularly those targeting lepidopteran larvae, are effective against leaf folders as well. Please refer to the chemical recommendations provided under "Caterpillars" for their effective management.
