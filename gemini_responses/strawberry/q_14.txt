As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an integrated approach for managing soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in strawberry cultivation, focusing on scientifically verified methods suitable for Haryana's conditions.

**General Principles for Soil Pest Management:**

1.  **Field Preparation:** Thorough land preparation is crucial. Remove all crop debris, weeds, and stubble that can harbor pests.
2.  **Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests to understand soil health and potential pest pressure.
3.  **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Combine cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods for sustainable control.

### 1. Termite Control in Strawberry

Termites can cause significant damage by feeding on roots and the crown of strawberry plants, leading to wilting and plant death.

**Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove all woody debris, old stumps, and other organic matter from the field that can attract termites.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** Expose termite colonies to predators and sunlight during summer fallow.

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting Soil Treatment):**
For effective termite control, pre-planting soil treatment is highly recommended.
*   **Chemical:** **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**
*   **Dosage:** 2.0 - 4.0 L per acre
*   **Application:** Mix the recommended quantity of **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC** with 200-400 L of water and drench the soil thoroughly before planting. Alternatively, incorporate it into the top 15-20 cm of soil during the final land preparation.

### 2. Nematodes (Root-knot) Control in Strawberry

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major threat to strawberries, causing galls on roots, stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and significant yield reduction.

**Cultural Methods:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate strawberries with non-host crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.), mustard, or cereals for at least 2-3 years. Marigold acts as a trap crop and releases nematicidal compounds.
*   **Solarization:** During the hot summer months (May-June), cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, killing nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens.
*   **Use of Healthy Planting Material:** Always use certified, nematode-free runners or tissue-cultured plants.
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 tonnes/acre) and neem cake (200-400 kg/acre) into the soil. Neem cake has nematicidal properties and enhances beneficial microbial activity.

**Biological Control:**
*   **Bio-nematicides:**
    *   **Chemical:** **Purpureocillium lilacinum** (or *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) based formulations.
    *   **Dosage:** 2.5 - 5.0 kg per acre (carrier-based formulation).
    *   **Application:** Mix the bio-nematicide with well-decomposed FYM or compost and apply it to the soil before planting. Alternatively, drench around the root zone of established plants.

**Chemical Control (Pre-planting/At Planting):**
*   **Chemical:** **Carbofuran 3% GR**
*   **Dosage:** 10-13 kg per acre
*   **Application:** Broadcast evenly and incorporate into the soil during the final land preparation before planting. For existing plants, it can be applied as a side-dressing around the plants and lightly incorporated, followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Read Label Instructions:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask, protective clothing) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   **Integrated Approach:** For long-term and sustainable control, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintaining good soil health through organic matter addition and balanced nutrition helps plants tolerate pest damage better.
