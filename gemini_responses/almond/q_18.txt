As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified recommendations for the use of growth regulators and boron in Almond cultivation in Haryana:

It is crucial to note that the application of growth regulators requires precise timing and dosage. Always follow label instructions and conduct a small-scale trial if unsure.

### Recommended Growth Regulators/Hormones and Micronutrients for Almond:

*   **Ethephon** (Commonly sold as Ethrel)
    *   **Purpose:** Ethephon is used to promote uniform hull split, which can facilitate earlier and more efficient mechanical harvesting.
    *   **Recommended Dose:** Apply **Ethephon** (e.g., 39% SL formulation) at a concentration of **1.5 - 2.5 ml/L** of water.
    *   **Timing:** Apply when approximately 5-10% of the hulls have naturally split. Ensure good spray coverage.

*   **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** (Commonly known as 2,4-D)
    *   **Recommendation:** **2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid** is primarily a broadleaf herbicide. Its use as a growth regulator in almond is **not recommended** due to the high risk of phytotoxicity (plant damage) even at very low concentrations, and the lack of established, safe, and beneficial recommendations for almond in our region. There are no scientifically verified standard practices for its application as a growth regulator in almond.

*   **Boron** (as a micronutrient)
    *   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fruit set, and overall tree vigor. Deficiency can lead to poor nut set and quality.
    *   **Recommended Dose:**
        *   **Foliar Spray:** Apply **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor, 20% Boron) at a rate of **1 - 1.5 g/L** of water.
        *   **Timing:**
            *   **Pre-bloom:** Apply at the pink bud stage to ensure adequate boron for pollen viability and fruit set.
            *   **Post-harvest:** A second application after harvest can help build up boron reserves for the following season.
    *   **Note:** Soil application of boron can also be done based on soil test results, typically at a rate of 1-2 kg of actual boron per acre, but foliar application is often more efficient for immediate uptake. Always conduct a soil test to determine boron levels before applying to the soil.
