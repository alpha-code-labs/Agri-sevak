Wilt, including Parawilt, in Almond is a serious concern that can significantly impact tree health and productivity. This condition is often caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens such as *Verticillium dahliae* (Verticillium Wilt) and *Fusarium oxysporum* (Fusarium Wilt), or can be a physiological response to severe environmental stress (which might be termed Parawilt in some contexts). Effective management requires an integrated approach focusing on prevention and cultural practices, as curative measures for established vascular wilts are challenging.

Here's a comprehensive approach to control Wilt in Almond:

**I. Cultural and Preventive Measures (Most Critical):**

*   **Site Selection and Soil Preparation:**
    *   Avoid planting almonds in fields previously used for susceptible crops like cotton, potato, tomato, brinjal, or other solanaceous crops, as these can harbor *Verticillium* and *Fusarium* pathogens.
    *   Ensure good soil drainage. Waterlogging can stress roots and make trees more susceptible to wilt pathogens.
    *   If possible, consider soil solarization during hot summer months (May-June) for 6-8 weeks before planting to reduce soil-borne pathogen inoculum.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:**
    *   Utilize rootstocks known for their resistance or tolerance to *Verticillium* and *Fusarium* wilts. Consult with nursery providers for locally adapted and resistant rootstock options suitable for Haryana's conditions.
*   **Planting Material:**
    *   Always use healthy, certified, disease-free planting material from reputable nurseries.
*   **Water Management:**
    *   Provide adequate and consistent irrigation. Both water stress and over-irrigation (leading to waterlogging) can predispose trees to wilt diseases.
    *   Use drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the root zone, minimizing leaf wetness and optimizing water use.
*   **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Maintain balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, susceptible growth. Ensure adequate potassium and micronutrients.
*   **Orchard Sanitation:**
    *   Promptly remove and destroy (burn or deep bury) any severely infected or dead trees/branches to reduce the source of inoculum.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or denatured alcohol between cuts and between trees, especially when working on infected trees.
*   **Pruning:**
    *   Prune out affected branches well below the visible symptoms of vascular discoloration.
*   **Weed Control:**
    *   Manage weeds effectively, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for wilt pathogens.

**II. Chemical Control (Supplementary and Preventive):**

Chemical control for established vascular wilt diseases in trees is generally difficult and often not curative. However, certain fungicides can be used as a preventive measure or to reduce soil inoculum, especially in young orchards or before planting.

*   **Soil Drenching/Root Zone Application:**
    *   For early stages of infection or as a preventive measure in high-risk areas, a systemic fungicide can be applied as a soil drench around the root zone.
    *   **Carbendazim 50% WP**: Apply at a rate of 2 grams per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of the tree with 5-10 litres of this solution per tree, depending on the tree size and age. Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions.
    *   **Thiophanate Methyl 70% WP**: Apply at a rate of 1.5-2 grams per litre of water. Drench the soil around the base of the tree with 5-10 litres of this solution per tree. Repeat application if necessary, following label instructions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Diagnosis:** Accurate diagnosis of the specific wilt pathogen is crucial for effective management. If possible, send samples of affected plant tissue (especially discolored vascular tissue) to a plant pathology lab for identification.
*   **Integrated Approach:** Relying solely on chemical control is not effective for wilt diseases. An integrated approach combining all the above measures is essential for long-term management.
*   **Consultation:** For severe or widespread issues, consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions.
