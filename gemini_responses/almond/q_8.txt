नमस्ते! As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling sucking pests in Almond, keeping in mind the context of Haryana and CIBRC approved chemicals.

Sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla can cause significant damage to Almond trees by feeding on sap, leading to stunted growth, leaf curling, premature leaf drop, and reduced yield. They can also transmit viral diseases.

Here's an integrated approach for their control:

**I. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Regular Monitoring:** Inspect your Almond trees frequently, especially new shoots and the undersides of leaves, to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Pruning:** Remove water sprouts and suckers, as these are often preferred feeding sites for aphids and other sucking pests. Proper pruning improves air circulation and light penetration, making the environment less favorable for pests.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds, as many weeds can act as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Water Sprays:** For minor aphid infestations, a strong jet of water can dislodge them from the plant.
*   **Dormant Oil Spray:** Application of horticultural mineral oil during the dormant season can help smother overwintering eggs and stages of some sucking pests.

**II. Biological Control:**

*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage beneficial insects like ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps, which are natural predators and parasitoids of aphids, whiteflies, and other sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
*   **Habitat Provision:** Plant flowering plants nearby that provide nectar and pollen for adult beneficial insects.

**III. Chemical Control (Use only when necessary and as a last resort, following CIBRC guidelines):**

When pest populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical intervention may be required. Always rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

**For general control of Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, Thrips, and Psylla:**

*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a concentration of **0.5 - 1.0 ml/L** of water. This is a systemic insecticide effective against a wide range of sucking pests.
*   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g/L** of water. Another systemic neonicotinoid effective against many sucking pests.
*   **Acetamiprid 20% SP:** Apply at a concentration of **0.2 - 0.4 g/L** of water. This is also a systemic insecticide with good efficacy against aphids, whiteflies, and thrips.

**For specific pest situations:**

*   **For Whiteflies and Leafhoppers (especially nymphs):**
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.0 - 1.25 ml/L** of water. This is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that specifically targets nymphs by inhibiting chitin synthesis.
*   **For Aphids (selective control):**
    *   **Flonicamid 50% WG:** Apply at a concentration of **0.3 g/L** of water. This is a selective aphicide with a different mode of action, making it useful for resistance management.
*   **For Thrips:**
    *   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply at a concentration of **1.0 - 1.5 ml/L** of water. Effective against thrips and some other sucking pests.

**Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**

*   **Timing:** Apply insecticides when pests are most vulnerable (e.g., early stages of infestation, nymphal stages).
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where many sucking pests reside.
*   **Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI):** Strictly observe the recommended pre-harvest interval for each chemical to ensure the safety of the produce.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and spraying. Follow all instructions on the product label.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent pests from developing resistance. Do not use the same chemical group repeatedly.

By adopting an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, biological, and judicious chemical controls, you can effectively manage sucking pests in your Almond orchard.
