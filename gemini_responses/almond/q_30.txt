As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must preface this advice by stating that Almond (Prunus dulcis) cultivation in Haryana faces significant challenges due to its specific climatic requirements, particularly the need for adequate chilling hours and its susceptibility to frost during flowering. While not a major commercial crop in the state, if you are cultivating Almond, managing growth issues is crucial. The following advice is based on general horticultural principles and nutrient management, tailored for the conditions in Haryana.

### Management of Growth Issues in Almond

#### 1. Slow Growth

Slow growth in Almond can be indicative of several underlying issues, primarily related to nutrition, soil health, or environmental stress.

*   **Soil Health and Nutrition:**
    *   **Soil Testing:** Conduct a comprehensive soil test to determine the nutrient status (macro and micro-nutrients) and pH. This is the most critical first step.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:** Based on soil test results, apply balanced fertilizers. Ensure adequate availability of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K).
        *   **Urea** (46% N): Apply as per soil test recommendations, typically in split applications during the growing season.
        *   **Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5): As a source of Phosphorus and some Nitrogen.
        *   **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** (60% K2O): As a source of Potassium.
    *   **Micronutrient Application:** If deficiencies are identified (e.g., Zinc, Iron, Manganese, Boron), apply as soil drench or foliar spray.
        *   **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn): 5 kg/acre for soil application or 0.5% foliar spray (5 g/L).
        *   **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe): 10 kg/acre for soil application or 0.5% foliar spray (5 g/L).
        *   **Manganese Sulphate** (30.5% Mn): 5 kg/acre for soil application or 0.5% foliar spray (5 g/L).
        *   **Borax** (10.5% B): 10-15 kg/acre for soil application or 0.1% foliar spray (1 g/L).
    *   **Organic Matter:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 kg/plant annually) to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **Water Management:** Ensure optimal irrigation. Both water stress (under-watering) and waterlogging (over-watering) can severely impede growth.
*   **Pest and Disease Management:** Identify and manage any root-knot nematodes, fungal diseases, or insect pests that might be stressing the plant and diverting energy from growth.

#### 2. Yellow Growth (Chlorosis)

Yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) is often a symptom of nutrient deficiencies, particularly micronutrients, or issues with nutrient uptake.

*   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Most commonly due to Iron (Fe) or Zinc (Zn) deficiency, especially prevalent in the alkaline soils found in parts of Haryana. Nitrogen (N) deficiency can also cause general yellowing of older leaves.
*   **Management:**
    *   **Soil Test:** Confirm specific nutrient deficiencies.
    *   **Iron Chlorosis:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Ferrous Sulphate** (19% Fe) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution, repeated at 10-15 day intervals until recovery.
        *   Soil application of **Ferrous Sulphate** at 10-20 kg/acre, or chelated iron (e.g., **Fe-EDTA**) at 100-200 g/plant for severe cases, mixed with organic matter.
    *   **Zinc Deficiency:**
        *   Foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate** (21% Zn) at 0.5% (5 g/L) solution.
        *   Soil application of **Zinc Sulphate** at 5-10 kg/acre.
    *   **Nitrogen Deficiency:** Apply **Urea** as per soil test, or a foliar spray of 1-2% **Urea** solution (10-20 g/L) for quick greening.
    *   **Soil pH Management:** If soil pH is high (alkaline), consider applying **Elemental Sulphur** at 200-500 kg/acre (depending on soil type and pH) to gradually lower pH and improve micronutrient availability. This is a long-term measure.
    *   **Drainage:** Ensure good soil drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can induce chlorosis by impairing root function and nutrient uptake.

#### 3. Excessive Height

Excessive height can lead to difficulties in harvesting, pruning, and overall orchard management.

*   **Pruning:** Regular and appropriate pruning is the primary method to manage tree height and canopy architecture.
    *   **Dormant Pruning:** Annually during winter dormancy to remove unwanted branches, maintain desired height, and encourage lateral growth.
    *   **Summer Pruning:** Light pruning after harvest to control vigor and shape.
*   **Rootstock Selection:** If planting new trees, choose dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks suitable for Almond, if available and adapted to Haryana conditions.
*   **Nitrogen Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which promotes vigorous vegetative growth. Base nitrogen application on soil test results and tree age/vigor.
*   **Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs):** Chemical growth retardants are not commonly recommended or specifically approved for height control in Almond in India by the Central Insecticides Board & Registration Committee (CIBRC). Cultural practices like pruning are preferred and more sustainable.

#### 4. Excessive Flowering

While flowering is essential, excessive flowering can lead to overcropping, resulting in smaller, lower-quality fruits and potentially biennial bearing.

*   **Pruning:** Strategic pruning can help manage the number of flower buds.
    *   **Dormant Pruning:** Remove some fruiting wood to reduce the potential flower load for the upcoming season.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Ensure balanced nutrition. While high carbohydrate reserves can lead to excessive flowering, avoiding excessive nitrogen can help balance vegetative and reproductive growth.
*   **Flower/Fruit Thinning:** If excessive flowering leads to overcropping and small, poor-quality fruits, manual or chemical thinning can be considered.
    *   **Manual Thinning:** Hand-thinning of flowers or young fruits can be done, though it is labor-intensive.
    *   **Chemical Thinning:** Chemical thinners like **Naphthalene Acetic Acid (NAA)** are used in some fruit crops. However, specific CIBRC approval for **NAA** for flower/fruit thinning in Almond in India is not widely available or recommended as a standard practice. The use of such chemicals requires careful calibration and can be risky if not applied correctly, potentially leading to over-thinning. Therefore, it is generally not recommended without specific local trials and approvals.
