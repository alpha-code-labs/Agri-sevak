As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide scientifically verified advice on addressing macro-nutrient deficiencies (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium) in Almonds, tailored for the Haryana region.

Macro-nutrient deficiencies are critical for almond health, yield, and nut quality. Accurate diagnosis is the first step, primarily through soil testing and leaf tissue analysis, which are far more reliable than visual symptoms alone. HAU recommends regular testing to determine precise nutrient requirements.

### General Approach to Macro-nutrient Management

1.  **Soil Testing:** Conduct soil tests every 2-3 years to assess nutrient availability and pH.
2.  **Leaf Tissue Analysis:** Perform leaf analysis annually, typically in July-August, to determine the actual nutrient status within the plant. This helps fine-tune fertilizer applications.
3.  **Integrated Nutrient Management (INM):** Combine chemical fertilizers with organic manures (Farm Yard Manure, compost) and bio-fertilizers for sustainable nutrient supply and improved soil health.

### Addressing Nitrogen (N) Deficiency

Nitrogen is crucial for vegetative growth, leaf development, and nut set.

**Symptoms of N Deficiency:**
*   Overall pale green to yellowish leaves, especially older leaves.
*   Reduced shoot growth and smaller leaves.
*   Premature leaf drop.
*   Poor fruit set and reduced nut size.

**Recommended Fertilizers and Application:**
Nitrogen application should be split to match the tree's demand throughout the growing season and minimize leaching losses.

*   **Fertilizer:** **Urea** (46% N) or **Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN)** (25% N).
*   **Application Rate (General Guideline for bearing trees, adjust based on soil/leaf analysis):**
    *   For young, non-bearing trees (1-3 years): 100-250 g **Urea** per tree per year, split into 2-3 applications.
    *   For bearing trees (4+ years): 500-1000 g **Urea** per tree per year, split into 3 applications:
        *   **First Application (25-30%):** Late dormant stage (February-March), just before bud break.
        *   **Second Application (40-50%):** Post-petal fall (April-May), during rapid shoot growth and fruit development.
        *   **Third Application (25-30%):** After harvest (July-August), to build reserves for the next season.
*   **Method:** Broadcast evenly under the tree canopy, avoiding direct contact with the trunk, and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

### Addressing Phosphorus (P) Deficiency

Phosphorus is vital for root development, flowering, fruit set, and energy transfer within the plant.

**Symptoms of P Deficiency:**
*   Stunted growth and small, dark green leaves.
*   Purplish discoloration on the underside of leaves (less common in almonds than other crops).
*   Poor root development.
*   Reduced flowering and fruit set.

**Recommended Fertilizers and Application:**
Phosphorus is relatively immobile in the soil, so it should be applied in the root zone.

*   **Fertilizer:** **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5) or **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5).
*   **Application Rate (General Guideline for bearing trees, adjust based on soil/leaf analysis):**
    *   For young, non-bearing trees: 100-200 g **DAP** or 250-500 g **SSP** per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees: 200-400 g **DAP** or 500-1000 g **SSP** per tree per year.
*   **Timing:** Apply the entire annual dose once, preferably during the dormant season (November-December) or early spring (February-March), before bud break.
*   **Method:** Broadcast evenly under the tree canopy and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. For established trees, banding or placement in furrows near the drip line can be effective.

### Addressing Potassium (K) Deficiency

Potassium (Potash) is essential for water regulation, disease resistance, fruit quality (size, kernel fill), and overall plant vigor.

**Symptoms of K Deficiency:**
*   Scorching or browning of leaf margins, starting from older leaves.
*   Reduced shoot growth and smaller leaves.
*   Poor kernel development and reduced nut size.
*   Increased susceptibility to diseases and environmental stress.

**Recommended Fertilizers and Application:**
Potassium is moderately mobile in the soil.

*   **Fertilizer:** **Muriate of Potash (MOP)** / **Potassium Chloride** (60% K2O) or **Sulphate of Potash (SOP)** / **Potassium Sulphate** (50% K2O, 18% S). SOP is preferred in soils with salinity issues or sulfur deficiency.
*   **Application Rate (General Guideline for bearing trees, adjust based on soil/leaf analysis):**
    *   For young, non-bearing trees: 100-250 g **Muriate of Potash** per tree per year.
    *   For bearing trees: 300-600 g **Muriate of Potash** per tree per year.
*   **Timing:** Apply the annual dose in 1-2 splits.
    *   **First Application (50-70%):** Early spring (February-March), before bud break.
    *   **Second Application (30-50%):** Post-petal fall (April-May) or after harvest (July-August).
*   **Method:** Broadcast evenly under the tree canopy and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate and timely irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient uptake and prevent root burn.
*   **Soil pH:** Almonds prefer slightly acidic to neutral soils (pH 6.0-7.0). Soil pH affects nutrient availability. If pH is outside this range, consult HAU for corrective measures.
*   **Organic Matter:** Incorporating Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (5-10 kg per tree annually) significantly improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability.
*   **HAU Consultation:** For precise recommendations based on your specific orchard's soil type, tree age, and yield goals, it is highly recommended to consult with the experts at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, or your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK). They can provide tailored advice based on detailed soil and leaf analysis reports.
