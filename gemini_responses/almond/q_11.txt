As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Beetles, Weevils, and Sawflies in Almond cultivation in Haryana.

It is crucial to adopt an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical methods for sustainable pest control.

### Control of Beetles and Weevils in Almond

Beetles (e.g., shot-hole borers, twig borers, defoliating beetles) and Weevils (e.g., twig girdlers, some root weevils) can cause significant damage to almond trees. Control strategies depend on the specific pest and the type of damage.

**1. Cultural and Mechanical Control:**

*   **Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, fruits, and infested twigs. This reduces overwintering sites for many pests.
*   **Pruning:** Prune out and destroy any branches showing signs of borer infestation (e.g., sawdust-like frass, wilting twigs). Ensure proper pruning techniques to avoid creating entry points for borers.
*   **Tree Vigor:** Maintain tree health and vigor through proper nutrition and irrigation. Healthy trees are more resilient to pest attacks.
*   **Trunk Protection:** For borers, protect the trunk base from mechanical injuries. White-washing the trunk with lime can sometimes deter egg-laying.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect trees for signs of pest activity, especially during critical growth stages.

**2. Chemical Control:**

Chemical control should be applied judiciously and only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold levels. Always follow label instructions for dosage and safety.

*   **For Borers (Beetles and Weevils affecting trunk/branches):**
    *   **Trunk Swabbing/Painting:**
        *   Apply a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC at 2.5 ml/L of water, or **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 1.0 ml/L of water, to the main trunk and basal parts of scaffold branches. This should be done before the onset of pest activity or immediately upon noticing initial signs of infestation.
    *   **Borehole Treatment:** If boreholes are visible, inject a small amount (e.g., 1-2 ml) of **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC (undiluted or slightly diluted) into the holes using a syringe and then plug the holes with mud or wax.

*   **For Defoliating Beetles and Weevils (feeding on leaves/twigs):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Cypermethrin** 25% EC at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   For systemic action against some defoliators, **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2 g/L of water can be used.

### Control of Sawflies in Almond

This is not known to affect Almond. Sawflies are generally not considered a significant pest of almond trees in Haryana or other almond-growing regions.

### General IPM Considerations:

*   **Timing:** Apply pesticides at the correct time, often coinciding with the vulnerable life stages of the pest or specific tree phenology.
*   **Resistance Management:** Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   **Safety:** Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide handling and application. Observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) strictly.
*   **Consultation:** For specific or severe infestations, consult with HAU experts or local agricultural extension officers for tailored advice.
