As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I must first clarify that commercial cultivation of Almond is generally not recommended for the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana. Almond trees require specific chilling hours during winter and are sensitive to high summer temperatures and frost during flowering, which are typically not met optimally across most parts of Haryana.

However, if you are cultivating Almond, the following recommendations for organic manures can be considered:

*   **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 5-10 kg per tree annually.
    *   **Bearing Trees (4 years and above):** 15-25 kg per tree annually.
    *   **Application:** Apply well-decomposed FYM during late autumn or early winter, incorporating it into the soil around the tree basin.

*   **Vermicompost:**
    *   **Young Trees (1-3 years):** 1-2 kg per tree annually.
    *   **Bearing Trees (4 years and above):** 3-5 kg per tree annually.
    *   **Application:** Vermicompost can be applied in split doses, for instance, half during pre-flowering and the remaining half during fruit development, mixed into the soil.

*   **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract based biostimulant):**
    *   **Foliar Spray:**
        *   **Dose:** 2.5-5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Application:** Apply as a foliar spray at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit set, and during fruit development (typically 2-3 sprays per season).
    *   **Soil Drench/Drip Irrigation:**
        *   **Dose:** 1-2 litres per acre.
        *   **Application:** Mix with irrigation water and apply during active growth phases to enhance nutrient uptake and plant vigour.
