As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned physical damages in Almond. It's crucial to understand that these issues are often multifactorial, stemming from environmental stress, nutritional imbalances, and improper cultural practices.

### 1. Fruit Bursting (Premature Hull Splitting or Kernel Cracking)

While hull splitting is a natural process in almond maturation, premature or uneven splitting of the hull, and kernel cracking, can lead to quality loss.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Irregular Water Supply:** Sudden fluctuations in soil moisture (e.g., heavy irrigation after a dry spell).
    *   **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Primarily Calcium and Boron.
    *   **Rapid Growth:** Often induced by excessive nitrogen or sudden favorable conditions.
    *   **Varietal Susceptibility:** Some varieties are more prone to cracking.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Irrigation:** Maintain uniform soil moisture, especially during fruit development. Avoid extremes of drought and waterlogging. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water delivery.
    *   **Balanced Nutrition:**
        *   Conduct regular soil and leaf tissue analysis to identify specific deficiencies.
        *   **Calcium:** If deficiency is confirmed, apply **Calcium nitrate** at 15-20 kg/acre as a soil application before flowering and during fruit development, or foliar spray of **Calcium chloride** (0.5-1.0%) at 5-10 g/L of water, 2-3 times during fruit development.
        *   **Boron:** If deficiency is confirmed, apply **Borax (Sodium tetraborate decahydrate)** at 5-10 kg/acre as a soil application every 2-3 years, or foliar spray of **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (0.1-0.2%) at 1-2 g/L of water, before flowering and at fruit set.
    *   **Pruning:** Ensure proper canopy management to allow good air circulation and light penetration, which helps in uniform fruit development.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for good hull integrity and resistance to kernel cracking suitable for Haryana's climate.

### 2. Leaf Burning/Melting

Leaf burn is a common symptom of various stresses, leading to reduced photosynthesis and tree vigor. "Melting" refers to severe tissue collapse.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Heat Stress/Sunburn:** High temperatures and intense solar radiation, especially on exposed leaves.
    *   **Water Stress:** Both drought (insufficient water) and waterlogging (excess water leading to root asphyxiation) can cause leaf scorch.
    *   **Salinity/Nutrient Toxicity:** High levels of salts (Sodium, Chloride) or specific micronutrients (e.g., Boron toxicity) in soil or irrigation water.
    *   **Pesticide/Fertilizer Burn:** Improper application rates, concentrations, or spraying during hot periods.
    *   **Wind Burn:** Desiccating winds can cause leaf edges to dry out.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Optimal Irrigation:** Provide adequate and consistent water, especially during hot and dry periods. Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
    *   **Soil Management:**
        *   Conduct soil tests to check for salinity and nutrient toxicities.
        *   If salinity is an issue, improve drainage, leach salts with good quality water, and apply organic matter. Gypsum (Calcium sulphate dihydrate) can be used to reclaim sodic soils.
    *   **Nutrient Management:**
        *   Address any identified nutrient deficiencies (e.g., Potassium deficiency can exacerbate heat stress). Apply **Potassium sulphate** at 50-100 kg/acre based on soil test.
        *   If Boron toxicity is suspected, avoid Boron applications and ensure good leaching.
    *   **Pesticide/Fertilizer Application:**
        *   Always follow recommended rates and timings.
        *   Avoid spraying during peak heat hours (11 AM - 4 PM) or when temperatures exceed 30°C.
        *   Ensure proper calibration of spray equipment.
    *   **Canopy Management:** Maintain a healthy canopy to provide self-shading for inner leaves and developing fruits.

### 3. Hardness in Fruit (Undesirable Kernel Texture or Hull Development Issues)

This typically refers to kernels that are excessively hard, brittle, or hulls that do not soften and split properly, affecting harvestability and quality.

*   **Causes:**
    *   **Water Stress:** Insufficient water during kernel filling and hull development can lead to smaller, harder kernels and hulls that fail to split.
    *   **Nutrient Imbalances:** Deficiencies in Potassium, Calcium, or Boron can affect cell wall development and overall fruit quality.
    *   **Premature Harvesting:** Harvesting before the kernels have fully matured and developed their characteristic texture.
    *   **Environmental Stress:** Extreme temperatures during critical development stages.
    *   **Varietal Characteristics:** Some varieties naturally produce harder kernels or shells.

*   **Control Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Water Management:** Ensure optimal soil moisture throughout the growing season, particularly from kernel development through hull split.
    *   **Balanced Fertilization:**
        *   Based on soil and leaf analysis, ensure adequate supply of essential nutrients.
        *   **Potassium:** Apply **Potassium sulphate** at 50-100 kg/acre or **Muriate of potash (Potassium chloride)** at 40-80 kg/acre, based on soil test recommendations, to improve kernel filling and quality.
        *   **Calcium and Boron:** As mentioned under "Fruit Bursting," these are crucial for cell wall integrity and overall fruit development.
    *   **Timely Harvesting:** Harvest almonds at the appropriate stage of maturity, typically when 90-100% of the hulls have split. Premature harvesting can result in underdeveloped, harder kernels.
    *   **Variety Selection:** Choose varieties known for desirable kernel texture and consistent hull splitting characteristics suitable for your region.
