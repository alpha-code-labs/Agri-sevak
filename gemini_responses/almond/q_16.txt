As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I strongly recommend conducting a comprehensive soil test before applying any fertilizers. Soil test results are crucial for determining the precise nutrient deficiencies and optimal fertilizer doses for your specific orchard conditions, tree age, and desired yield.

However, in the absence of a soil test, the following are general guidelines for fertilizer application for **mature bearing Almond trees (typically 5 years and older)** in Haryana. These recommendations should be split into multiple applications throughout the growing season for better nutrient uptake and reduced leaching.

**General Application Schedule:**
*   **First Application (Pre-flowering/Bud break - February-March):** Apply half of the recommended Nitrogen (N), all of the Phosphorus (P), and half of the Potassium (K) and Sulphur.
*   **Second Application (After Fruit Set - April-May):** Apply the remaining half of Nitrogen and Potassium.
*   **Third Application (Post-harvest, if needed - June-July):** A small dose of Nitrogen and Potassium can be applied if tree vigor is low, especially in high-yielding orchards.

**Recommended Doses (per mature bearing tree per year):**

*   **Urea (46% N):**
    *   **Dose:** 1.5 - 2.0 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2-3 applications as described above. Apply by broadcasting evenly around the tree within the drip line and lightly incorporating into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Nano-Urea (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit development, and post-harvest for enhanced nitrogen uptake and vigor. This is supplementary to basal urea application, not a replacement.

*   **DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate - 18% N, 46% P2O5):**
    *   **Dose:** 0.8 - 1.0 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose during the first application (pre-flowering/bud break). Place in a band around the tree within the drip line or in shallow trenches, and cover with soil.

*   **Nano-DAP (Liquid):**
    *   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Application:** Foliar spray. Apply 2-3 sprays at critical growth stages such as pre-flowering, fruit development, and post-harvest. This is supplementary to basal DAP application.

*   **NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
    *   **Dose:** If using a complex NPK fertilizer (e.g., 10:26:26, 12:32:16, 19:19:19), the dose will vary significantly based on the specific grade and nutrient requirements.
    *   **Application:** Consult with HAU experts or adjust the individual fertilizer recommendations (Urea, DAP, Potash) to match the nutrient contribution from the NPK complex. Generally, NPK fertilizers are applied as a basal dose.

*   **SSP (Single Super Phosphate - 16% P2O5, 11% S):**
    *   **Dose:** If used as an alternative to DAP for Phosphorus and Sulphur, apply 2.0 - 2.5 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose during the first application (pre-flowering/bud break). If SSP is used, the separate application of elemental Sulphur might be reduced or omitted, and the Urea dose adjusted as SSP does not provide Nitrogen like DAP.

*   **Potash (Muriate of Potash - MOP, 60% K2O):**
    *   **Dose:** 1.5 - 2.0 kg per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Split into 2 applications (half pre-flowering, half after fruit set). Apply by broadcasting evenly around the tree within the drip line and lightly incorporating into the soil, followed by irrigation.

*   **Sulphur (Elemental Sulphur 90%):**
    *   **Dose:** 100 - 150 g per tree per year.
    *   **Application:** Apply as a basal dose during the first application (pre-flowering/bud break). Incorporate into the soil. If SSP is used, the requirement for additional elemental Sulphur may be reduced.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Young Trees:** For young, non-bearing trees (1-4 years), the fertilizer doses should be significantly reduced. A general rule is to apply 1/10th of the mature tree dose for each year of age (e.g., 1/10th for 1-year-old, 2/10th for 2-year-old, etc.).
*   **Micronutrients:** Almonds also require micronutrients like Zinc, Boron, Iron, Manganese, and Copper. A soil test will identify any deficiencies. Foliar sprays of micronutrient mixtures can be applied if deficiencies are observed or suspected.
*   **Organic Manures:** Supplementing chemical fertilizers with well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg per tree per year) is highly beneficial for soil health and nutrient availability. Apply FYM during autumn or early winter.
*   **Irrigation:** Ensure adequate irrigation after fertilizer application to facilitate nutrient dissolution and uptake by the roots.
