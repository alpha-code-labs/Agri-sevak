As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned pests in Almond orchards in Haryana:

---

### **1. Grasshopper**

Grasshoppers can cause damage to almond trees, particularly to young foliage, shoots, and sometimes developing nuts, especially during outbreaks.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Maintain a clean orchard floor by regularly removing weeds, which can serve as shelter and alternative food sources for grasshoppers.
*   **Mechanical Control:**
    *   In small orchards, hand-picking of grasshoppers can be effective, especially during early morning hours when they are less active.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   Spray with **Lambda-cyhalothrin** 5 EC at 0.5 ml per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Malathion** 50 EC at 2 ml per litre of water.

### **2. Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)**

This is not known to affect Almond. Painted bug is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

---

### **3. Red Cotton Bug (Dysdercus cingulatus)**

This is not known to affect Almond. Red cotton bug is primarily a pest of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

### **4. Black Ants**

Black ants are generally not direct primary pests of almond trees in terms of feeding on the plant itself. However, their presence can indicate or exacerbate other issues:

*   **Indirect Damage:** Ants are often attracted to the honeydew secreted by sap-sucking pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. They protect these pests from natural enemies, allowing their populations to increase and cause more significant damage to the almond tree.
*   **Direct Nuisance/Minor Damage:** In some cases, ants may nest in tree trunks (especially if there are existing wounds), potentially weakening the tree. While less common, some species might feed on flowers or young fruit.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural and Physical Control:**
    *   **Control Primary Pests:** The most effective way to manage ants is to control the honeydew-producing pests (aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) that attract them. Once their food source is eliminated, ant populations will naturally decline.
    *   **Sticky Bands:** Apply sticky bands (e.g., non-drying tree grease or commercial sticky barriers) around the trunk of the tree to prevent ants from climbing up into the canopy.
    *   **Orchard Sanitation:** Keep the orchard clean and free of debris that can provide nesting sites for ants.
*   **Chemical Control (if ants are causing significant direct issues or are severely interfering with pest management):**
    *   Use ant baits containing **Fipronil** 0.01% at 10-20 g per colony or along ant trails. Baits are effective as ants carry the insecticide back to their nest, targeting the entire colony.
    *   For ground nests or trails around the base of the tree, a spot application of **Chlorpyrifos** 20 EC at 2.5 ml per litre of water can be used as a drench, ensuring it does not come into direct contact with the tree trunk or foliage, especially during fruiting.
