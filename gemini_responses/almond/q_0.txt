As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Almond in Haryana. Effective management relies on an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, combining cultural practices with timely and appropriate chemical applications.

Here's the status and control measures for the fungal diseases you listed:

### Fungal Diseases Affecting Almond and Their Control

**1. Alternaria Leaf Spot/Blight (Caused by *Alternaria alternata*)**
This disease is known to affect Almond, causing dark spots on leaves, which can lead to defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune out and destroy infected twigs and mummified fruits to reduce inoculum.
    *   Ensure good air circulation within the canopy through proper pruning.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides preventively during periods of high humidity and leaf wetness, especially from spring through summer.
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water.

**2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum acutatum*)**
Anthracnose is known to affect Almond, causing lesions on leaves, twigs, and fruits, leading to dieback and fruit rot.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Remove and destroy infected plant parts, including mummified fruits.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides during bloom and early fruit development, and repeat as necessary, especially during wet periods.
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Pyraclostrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water.

**3. Blast**
This is not known to affect Almond as a specific fungal disease. (Bacterial blast, caused by *Pseudomonas syringae*, is a different condition).

**4. Blight (e.g., Blossom Blight, Shoot Blight, Leaf Blight)**
Various fungal blights are known to affect Almond.
*   **Blossom Blight (Caused by *Monilinia laxa*):** Affects blossoms, leading to their browning and death.
*   **Shoot Blight (Caused by *Botryosphaeria dothidea*, *Phomopsis* spp.):** Causes dieback of shoots and branches.
*   **Leaf Blight (Can be caused by *Alternaria*, *Stigmina*):** Leads to leaf spots and defoliation.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune out and destroy all blighted twigs and branches, making cuts into healthy wood.
    *   Sanitize pruning tools between cuts.
    *   Ensure good air circulation.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For Blossom Blight, apply fungicides at pink bud, full bloom, and petal fall stages.
    *   For Shoot and Leaf Blights, apply during susceptible growth stages and wet periods.
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1 ml/L water.
    *   **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Difenoconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).

**5. Brown Spot / Shot Hole (Caused by *Stigmina carpophila*)**
This disease is known to affect Almond, causing small, purplish-brown spots on leaves, which often fall out, leaving a "shot hole" appearance. It can also affect twigs and fruits.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Prune out and destroy infected twigs.
    *   Ensure good sanitation in the orchard.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides at leaf fall, dormant stage, and again at bud break and during spring rains.
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2 kg/acre (or 2 g/L water).
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
    *   **Ziram** at 2.5 kg/acre (or 2.5 g/L water).
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75-1 ml/L water.

**6. Downy Mildew**
This is not known to affect Almond.

**7. Powdery Mildew (Caused by *Podosphaera tridactyla*)**
Powdery mildew is known to affect Almond, appearing as white, powdery patches on leaves, shoots, and sometimes fruits, leading to distortion and reduced vigor.

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Ensure good air circulation through proper tree spacing and pruning.
    *   Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   Apply fungicides at the first sign of disease and repeat as necessary, especially during warm, dry periods with high humidity.
    *   **Sulphur** (Wettable Powder) at 2-3 g/L water.
    *   **Myclobutanil** at 0.4-0.5 g/L water.
    *   **Penconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Hexaconazole** at 0.5 ml/L water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L water.

**8. Grey Mildew**
This is not known to affect Almond by this specific name. (Grey mold, caused by *Botrytis cinerea*, is a different fungal disease).

### General Recommendations for Fungal Disease Management:

*   **Orchard Sanitation:** Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves, mummified fruits, and pruned diseased branches to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Pruning:** Maintain an open canopy to improve air circulation and light penetration, which helps reduce humidity and fungal growth.
*   **Irrigation:** Use drip irrigation to avoid wetting foliage, especially during critical periods. If overhead irrigation is used, do so in the morning to allow foliage to dry quickly.
*   **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition to maintain tree vigor, but avoid excessive nitrogen that can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
*   **Fungicide Rotation:** Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of fungicide resistance.
*   **Timing:** The efficacy of fungicides is highly dependent on timely application, often before disease symptoms are widespread or during critical growth stages (e.g., bud break, bloom, petal fall).
*   **Adherence to Label:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the fungicide label for dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals (PHI).

For specific recommendations tailored to your orchard's conditions and the prevailing disease pressure, it is always advisable to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts.
