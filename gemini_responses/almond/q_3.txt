Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding various rot types in Almond. Effective management requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved chemicals.

Here's a scientifically verified guide for controlling rot diseases in Almond, specifically tailored for conditions in Haryana:

**General Cultural Practices for Rot Prevention (Applicable to all Rot Types):**

*   **Site Selection and Drainage:** Plant almonds in well-drained soils. Avoid low-lying areas prone to waterlogging, which is a major predisposing factor for most root and crown rots.
*   **Irrigation Management:** Apply irrigation judiciously. Avoid overwatering, especially around the tree trunk. Drip irrigation is often preferred to minimize wetting of the trunk base.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil structure and organic matter content to improve drainage and aeration.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the tree base free of weeds to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant parts (roots, branches, mummified fruits) to reduce inoculum sources.
*   **Avoid Injury:** Protect tree trunks from mechanical injuries during cultivation, which can create entry points for pathogens.
*   **Resistant Rootstocks:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, consider using rootstocks known for resistance to specific rot pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*).

### 1. Root Rot, Stem Rot, Foot Rot, Collar Rot, Crown Rot, and Neck Rot

These rot types often share common fungal and oomycete pathogens, primarily *Phytophthora spp.* and sometimes *Armillaria mellea* (Oak Root Fungus). They affect the root system, crown (junction of root and stem), and the lower part of the trunk.

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunted growth, dieback of branches, cankers at the soil line, reddish-brown discoloration of bark and wood, and eventual tree death.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Improve soil drainage immediately.
    *   Expose the crown and upper roots to air by removing soil from around the base of the trunk (tree surgery) to allow drying.
    *   Avoid piling soil or mulch against the trunk.
    *   For *Armillaria* (Oak Root Fungus), chemical control on established trees is very difficult. Focus on removing infected trees and roots, and consider soil solarization in affected areas before replanting.
*   **Chemical (Drenching/Painting):**
    *   **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP: Apply as a drench at 2.5-3.0 kg per 1000 litres of water around the base of the affected trees. Repeat after 30-45 days if necessary.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: Drench the soil around the base of the tree with a solution of 2.5-3.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 3.75% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP: Drench the soil around the tree base with 2.5-3.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Copper oxychloride** 50% WP: Prepare a thick paste with water and paint the affected trunk/collar region after scraping off diseased bark. Alternatively, drench the soil around the base with 3.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Potassium phosphonate** (e.g., 40% SL): Apply as a drench at 5-7 ml per litre of water or as a foliar spray. This can enhance the tree's natural defense mechanisms.

### 2. Fruit Rot

Almond fruits (drupes) can be affected by various fungi, leading to rot, especially under humid conditions. Common pathogens include *Monilinia spp.* (Brown Rot), *Botrytis cinerea* (Gray Mold), and *Rhizopus stolonifer* (Rhizopus Rot).

**Symptoms:** Brown, soft spots on the hull or kernel, often covered with fungal growth, leading to mummification of fruits.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Prune trees to improve air circulation within the canopy.
    *   Remove and destroy all mummified fruits from the tree and the ground, as they serve as inoculum sources.
    *   Harvest fruits promptly when mature.
*   **Chemical (Foliar Sprays during fruit development):**
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: Spray at 1.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Thiophanate-methyl** 70% WP: Spray at 1.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** 23% SC: Spray at 0.5-1.0 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Captan** 50% WP: Spray at 2.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Tebuconazole** 25.9% EC: Spray at 0.75 ml per litre of water.
    *   **Fluxapyroxad** 6.25% + **Pyraclostrobin** 6.25% SC: Spray at 1.0-1.5 ml per litre of water.

### 3. Seed Rot and Seedling Rot

These conditions primarily affect almond seeds during germination and young seedlings (damping-off). Pathogens like *Pythium spp.* and *Rhizoctonia solani* are common culprits.

**Symptoms:** Seeds fail to germinate or rot before emergence (seed rot). Young seedlings collapse at the soil line, become water-soaked, and die (damping-off).

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:**
    *   Use high-quality, healthy seeds from reputable sources.
    *   Plant seeds in well-drained, sterilized potting mix or nursery beds.
    *   Avoid overwatering and ensure proper spacing to improve air circulation.
*   **Chemical (Seed Treatment / Drench):**
    *   **Thiram** 75% WS: Treat seeds at 2.5-3.0 g per kg of seed before sowing.
    *   **Captan** 75% WS: Treat seeds at 2.0-2.5 g per kg of seed before sowing.
    *   **Carbendazim** 50% WP: For seedling rot, drench the soil around seedlings with 1.0 g per litre of water.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES: For *Pythium* related issues, treat seeds at 3.0 ml per kg of seed.
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL: For *Pythium* related issues, drench the soil around seedlings with 2.0-3.0 ml per litre of water.

### 4. Black Rot

This is not known to affect Almond as a distinct disease entity. While almond fruits can develop dark, rotted areas due to various fungal infections, 'Black Rot' is a specific disease name primarily associated with grapes (*Guignardia bidwellii*) and apples (*Botryosphaeria obtusa*).

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the label instructions for any chemical product regarding dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest intervals.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   For specific diagnosis and tailored advice, it is always recommended to consult with local agricultural extension specialists or HAU experts, especially if the problem persists.

By implementing these integrated management strategies, you can effectively control rot diseases in your almond orchard.
