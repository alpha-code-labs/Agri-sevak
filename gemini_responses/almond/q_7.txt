As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling Dieback, Twig blight, and Tikka disease in Almond, keeping in mind the specific conditions and approved practices for Haryana.

### Tikka Disease

This is not known to affect Almond. Tikka disease is primarily a foliar disease of groundnut (peanut).

### Dieback and Twig Blight in Almond

Dieback and Twig blight are often caused by various fungal pathogens (e.g., *Botryosphaeria* species, *Monilinia laxa*, *Phytophthora* species, *Verticillium dahliae*). Effective control requires an integrated approach combining cultural practices and timely chemical interventions.

**I. Cultural and Management Practices (Integrated Pest Management - IPM):**

1.  **Pruning:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for symptoms of dieback (dead or dying branches) and twig blight (withered twigs, cankers).
    *   Prune out all affected branches and twigs well below the visible symptoms into healthy wood. Make clean cuts.
    *   Disinfect pruning tools with a 10% bleach solution or methylated spirit between cuts, especially when moving from diseased to healthy parts of the tree, to prevent disease spread.
2.  **Sanitation:**
    *   Collect and immediately destroy (burn or bury deep) all pruned diseased material, fallen leaves, and mummified fruits. Do not leave them in the orchard as they can serve as sources of inoculum for future infections.
3.  **Wound Protection:**
    *   Protect large pruning cuts (diameter > 2 cm) with a Bordeaux paste or a fungicidal paint (e.g., containing **Copper Oxychloride**) to prevent entry of pathogens.
4.  **Orchard Hygiene:**
    *   Maintain good air circulation within the canopy by proper pruning.
    *   Control weeds around the base of the trees to reduce humidity and potential pathogen reservoirs.
5.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Ensure balanced nutrition to maintain tree vigor, as healthy trees are more resilient to diseases. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote lush, susceptible growth.
6.  **Irrigation Management:**
    *   Avoid waterlogging, especially around the root zone, as some dieback pathogens (e.g., *Phytophthora*) thrive in wet conditions. Use drip irrigation where feasible.

**II. Chemical Control (Fungicides):**

Fungicide applications should be timed strategically, often during dormancy, bud break, bloom, and post-harvest, depending on the specific pathogen and disease pressure. Always follow label instructions for application rates and safety precautions.

1.  **For General Fungal Dieback and Twig Blight (Preventive and Curative):**
    *   **During Dormancy/Pre-bud break:**
        *   Spray with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water. This provides a protective barrier against many fungal and bacterial pathogens.
    *   **At Bud Swell/Early Bloom (if disease pressure is high or historically present):**
        *   Spray with **Carbendazim 50% WP** at 0.5 g/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Mancozeb 75% WP** at 2.5 g/L of water.
    *   **Post-Bloom/Fruit Set (if symptoms appear or for continued protection):**
        *   Spray with **Propiconazole 25% EC** at 0.5 ml/L of water.
        *   Alternatively, use **Tebuconazole 25.9% EC** at 0.75 ml/L of water.
        *   These systemic fungicides offer both protective and curative action against a range of fungal diseases.
    *   **Post-Harvest:**
        *   A protective spray with **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP** at 3 g/L of water can help reduce inoculum for the next season, especially after pruning.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Fungicides:** To prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rotate fungicides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing:** The efficacy of fungicides is highly dependent on timely application. Consult local agricultural extension services for precise timing based on local weather conditions and disease forecasts.
*   **Coverage:** Ensure thorough spray coverage of all parts of the tree, especially the canopy and branches.

By implementing these integrated strategies, almond growers in Haryana can effectively manage Dieback and Twig blight, ensuring healthy tree growth and optimal yields.
