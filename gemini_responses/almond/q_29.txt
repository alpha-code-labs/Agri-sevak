This is not known to affect Almond. "Tinda/Boll dropping" refers to conditions in crops like Tinda (round gourd) or cotton (boll dropping), which are botanically distinct from Almond. Almond is a drupe, not a boll-forming plant or a cucurbit.

However, "Flower drop" and "Fruit drop" are common physiological phenomena in Almond. These can be due to various factors, and controlling them involves a combination of good agricultural practices and nutritional management.

Here's how to control excessive flower and fruit drop in Almond:

1.  **Ensure Adequate Pollination:**
    *   Almonds require cross-pollination for good fruit set. Ensure you have planted compatible pollinizer varieties in your orchard.
    *   Introduce 8-10 bee colonies per hectare during the flowering period to facilitate effective pollen transfer. Poor pollination is a major cause of flower and young fruit drop.

2.  **Optimize Nutritional Management:**
    *   **Boron:** This micronutrient is crucial for pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and overall fruit set.
        *   Apply a foliar spray of **Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate** (20% Boron) at 1.5-2.0 g/L of water. Apply once before flowering (at bud swell stage) and again at petal fall.
    *   **Zinc:** Essential for hormone synthesis and overall plant vigor, which indirectly supports fruit retention.
        *   Apply a foliar spray of **Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate** (21% Zinc) at 5 g/L of water or **Chelated Zinc** (12% Zinc) at 1 g/L of water. Apply once before flowering and again at fruit set.
    *   **Balanced NPK:** Ensure the tree receives balanced macro-nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) based on soil test recommendations to support overall tree health and fruit development.

3.  **Maintain Optimal Water Management:**
    *   Both water stress (drought) and waterlogging can lead to flower and fruit drop.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture, especially during critical stages like flowering and fruit development. Drip irrigation is highly recommended for precise water delivery.

4.  **Manage Environmental Stress:**
    *   **Temperature Extremes:** Frost during flowering can severely damage flowers and lead to drop. High temperatures during fruit development can also cause stress. While direct control is difficult, healthy trees are more resilient.
    *   **Wind:** Strong winds can physically dislodge flowers and young fruits. Planting windbreaks can help.

5.  **Overall Tree Health:**
    *   Ensure trees are free from major pest and disease infestations, as stressed trees are more prone to dropping flowers and fruits.
    *   Maintain proper pruning practices to ensure good light penetration and air circulation, promoting healthy growth.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce excessive flower and fruit drop in your almond orchard.
