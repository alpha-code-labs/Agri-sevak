As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I will provide you with scientifically verified advice for controlling these pests in Almond cultivation in Haryana.

First, let's address each pest individually:

**Diamondback Moth (DBM):**
This is not known to affect Almond. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*) is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops (e.g., cabbage, cauliflower, mustard) and does not infest almond trees.

Now, for the pests that can affect Almond:

### Control of Borers in Almond

Borers can cause significant damage by tunneling into the trunk, branches, or twigs, weakening the tree and sometimes leading to its death.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect trees for signs of borer activity (e.g., sawdust-like frass, gum exudation, boreholes).
    *   Prune and destroy severely infested or dead branches to remove borer larvae and pupae.
    *   Maintain tree vigour through proper nutrition and irrigation, as healthy trees are more resilient to borer attacks.
    *   Avoid mechanical injuries to the trunk and branches, as these can serve as entry points for borers.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **For Stem Borers (e.g., *Indarbela* spp.):**
        *   **Injection Method:** Locate the active boreholes. Inject 5-10 ml of **Dichlorvos** (76% EC) into each borehole using a syringe, then plug the hole with wet mud or cotton to trap the fumes. This is highly effective against active larvae inside the trunk/branches.
        *   **Swabbing/Drenching:** As a preventive measure or for early-stage infestations, swab the trunk and main branches up to 1 meter height with a solution of **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) @ 5 ml/L of water, especially before the monsoon and post-monsoon.
    *   **For Shot-hole Borers:**
        *   Prune and destroy infested twigs.
        *   Spray the affected parts with **Chlorpyrifos** (20% EC) @ 2.5 ml/L of water.

### Control of Caterpillars and Leaf Folders in Almond

Various caterpillar species can infest almond, causing defoliation by feeding on leaves, or damaging fruits. Leaf folders specifically roll or fold leaves and feed from within.

**Integrated Management Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regular monitoring of the orchard for the presence of caterpillars and leaf folders, especially during flushing and fruiting stages.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying visible larvae in the early stages of infestation, particularly on young trees.
    *   Maintain orchard hygiene by removing weeds and debris that can harbor pests.
    *   Use pheromone traps for monitoring adult moth populations, which helps in timing control measures.

*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies like parasitic wasps and predatory birds.
    *   For early instars of caterpillars, especially in an IPM approach, spray **Bacillus thuringiensis** (WP formulation) @ 1-2 g/L of water. This is a biological insecticide that specifically targets lepidopteran larvae.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective control of a wide range of caterpillars and leaf folders, consider the following CIBRC-approved insecticides:
        *   **Emamectin Benzoate** (5% SG) @ 0.2-0.4 g/L of water. This is highly effective against lepidopteran pests.
        *   **Chlorantraniliprole** (18.5% SC) @ 0.15-0.2 ml/L of water. This is a newer generation insecticide with excellent efficacy against caterpillars and leaf folders.
        *   **Lambda-cyhalothrin** (5% EC) @ 0.5-1.0 ml/L of water. This provides quick knockdown and is effective against a broad spectrum of pests, including caterpillars.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pesticide resistance.
*   Apply pesticides during calm weather conditions, preferably in the morning or late afternoon, to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage and affected parts of the tree during spraying.
