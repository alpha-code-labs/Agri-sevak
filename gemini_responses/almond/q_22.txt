As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my advice is tailored to the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana.

Almond (Prunus dulcis) is a temperate fruit crop that requires a specific set of climatic conditions, particularly a significant number of chilling hours (typically 200-700 hours below 7°C, depending on the cultivar) during winter for proper dormancy breaking, flowering, and fruit set. It also prefers dry, warm summers for nut development and ripening.

The agro-climatic conditions of Haryana, characterized by a subtropical to semi-arid climate with mild winters (often insufficient chilling hours) and extremely hot summers, are generally **not suitable for the commercial cultivation of Almond**. While some experimental or backyard plantings might exist, large-scale commercial cultivation is not recommended due to the high risk of poor flowering, fruit set, and overall low productivity.

Therefore, specific recommended cultivation practices (Sowing method/pattern, Planting depth, Spacing, and Seed dose) for commercial almond production are **not provided for Haryana** as it is not a commercially viable or recommended crop for the region.
