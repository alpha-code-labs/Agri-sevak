As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling viral diseases in Almond:

Firstly, regarding specific viruses mentioned:

*   **Tristeza:** This is not known to affect Almond. Citrus Tristeza Virus (CTV) primarily affects citrus species.

For the other viral diseases (Leaf curl, Mosaic, Yellow vein clearing, Stripe, and Stunt virus), which are often symptoms of viruses like *Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV)* and *Prune dwarf virus (PDV)* in Almond, it is crucial to understand that there are no chemical cures for established viral infections in plants. Control strategies primarily focus on prevention and cultural practices to limit their spread.

Here are the recommended control measures:

*   **Use Certified Virus-Free Planting Material:** This is the most critical preventative measure. Always source rootstock and scion wood from reputable nurseries that provide certified virus-free material.
*   **Roguing and Removal of Infected Trees:**
    *   Regularly inspect your orchard for trees showing symptoms such as leaf distortion, mosaic patterns, yellowing, stunting, or reduced vigour.
    *   Promptly remove and destroy (e.g., by burning) any trees confirmed to be infected to prevent the spread of the virus to healthy trees.
*   **Sanitation of Tools:**
    *   Disinfect pruning shears, saws, and other tools regularly, especially when moving between trees or after working on a suspected infected tree. This helps prevent mechanical transmission of viruses.
*   **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds within and around the orchard, as some weeds can act as alternate hosts for certain viruses, allowing them to persist and potentially spread to almond trees.
*   **No Chemical Cure:**
    *   It is important to reiterate that there are no viricides (chemicals that kill viruses) available for plant viruses. Therefore, chemical applications are not effective in treating infected trees. Control efforts must focus on the preventative and cultural practices listed above.
