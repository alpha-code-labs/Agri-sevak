Dear farmer,

Almond trees, particularly when young or under stress, can indeed be affected by soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes. Effective management requires a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of CIBRC-approved pesticides.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling these soil pests in Almond:

**I. General Principles for Soil Pest Management:**
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through regular addition of organic matter (Farm Yard Manure, compost) to enhance beneficial microbial activity.
*   **Proper Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, which can make trees more susceptible to pest attack.
*   **Weed Control:** Keep the area around the trees free of weeds, which can harbor pests.
*   **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect the base of trees and roots (if possible) for signs of damage.

**II. Control of Termites (Odontotermes spp., Microtermes spp.):**
Termites can damage the roots and collar region of almond trees, leading to wilting and eventual death, especially in young plants.

*   **Pre-planting Treatment (Highly Recommended):**
    *   Before planting, treat the pit with an insecticide solution.
    *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 20 ml in 10 litres of water and drench each planting pit thoroughly.
*   **Post-planting / Established Trees:**
    *   **Soil Drenching:** If termite activity is observed around the base of established trees, drench the soil around the trunk.
        *   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC**: Mix 2.5-5 ml per litre of water and apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree, depending on its size and spread of infestation. Ensure the solution penetrates the soil around the root zone.
        *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL**: Mix 0.75-1.0 ml per litre of water and apply 5-10 litres of solution per tree as a soil drench.

**III. Control of Root-Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.):**
Root-knot nematodes cause galls on roots, impairing nutrient and water uptake, leading to stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced yield.

*   **Integrated Management is Key:** Due to the difficulty of eradicating nematodes in established trees, an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods is most effective.
*   **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Solarization:** In fallow land before planting, solarization (covering moist soil with clear plastic sheets during hot months) can reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate large quantities of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost (20-30 kg/tree annually) and **Neem cake** (2-5 kg/tree annually) into the soil around the root zone. Neem cake has nematicidal properties.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus):** Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre or 50-100 g per tree, mixed with 25-50 kg of FYM/compost, and apply to the root zone. This bio-nematicide parasitizes nematode eggs and females.
    *   **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** Apply 2.5-5 kg per acre or 50-100 g per tree, mixed with FYM/compost, for root protection and growth promotion.
*   **Chemical Control (Judicious Use):**
    *   For severe infestations, CIBRC-approved granular nematicides can be used, but their application requires careful timing and incorporation.
    *   **Carbofuran 3% G**: Apply 50-100 g per tree (or 30-60 kg/acre) around the root zone and lightly incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation. This is generally recommended for young trees or as a pre-plant treatment.
    *   **Phorate 10% G**: Apply 20-30 g per tree (or 10-15 kg/acre) around the root zone and incorporate into the soil, followed by irrigation.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts for precise recommendations tailored to your specific field conditions and the severity of the infestation.
*   Ensure proper safety gear (gloves, mask, protective clothing) is used during pesticide application.

By adopting these measures, you can effectively manage soil pests in your almond orchard and ensure healthy tree growth and productivity.
