As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), my primary responsibility is to provide scientifically verified and practical advice relevant to the agricultural conditions and recommended crops for Haryana, India.

It is important to note that Almond (Prunus dulcis) is a temperate fruit crop requiring specific climatic conditions, including sufficient chilling hours during winter and dry summers, which are generally not met in Haryana. Therefore, commercial cultivation of Almonds is not recommended or widely practiced in the state, and HAU does not typically issue specific recommendations for its cultivation or pest/weed management in Haryana.

However, if we consider a hypothetical scenario for weed control in an orchard setting, the following general principles and CIBRC-approved chemical recommendations can be applied, keeping in mind that specific dosages and timings should always be confirmed with local agricultural experts for the exact crop and conditions.

**Weed Control in a Hypothetical Almond Orchard:**

**1. Orobanche:**
This is not known to affect Almond. Orobanche (broomrape) species are parasitic weeds that typically infest specific host plants, primarily from families like Solanaceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae. Almond is not a known host for Orobanche.

**2. General Weed Management (Broadleaf, Narrowleaf, Amarbail, Bathu, Congress grass, Phalaris minor):**

Effective weed management in orchards involves a combination of cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods.

**A. Cultural and Mechanical Methods:**
*   **Mulching:** Applying organic mulches (e.g., straw, wood chips, crop residues) around the base of the trees can suppress weed growth, conserve soil moisture, and regulate soil temperature.
*   **Inter-row Cultivation/Mowing:** Regular mowing or light cultivation in the inter-row spaces can manage weeds effectively.
*   **Manual Weeding:** Especially for weeds close to the tree trunk or for parasitic weeds like Amarbail, manual removal is crucial.

**B. Chemical Control (Herbicides):**
Herbicides should be applied carefully, avoiding contact with the green parts (leaves, young bark) of the almond trees. Directed sprays are essential.

*   **Pre-emergence Herbicides (for Broadleaf and Narrowleaf weeds, including Amarbail prevention):**
    These are applied to the soil before weed seeds germinate.
    *   **Pendimethalin 30% EC:** Apply at 3.3-5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.
    *   **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC:** Apply at 0.85-1.7 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.

*   **Post-emergence Herbicides (for actively growing weeds):**

    *   **Non-selective Herbicides (for general weed control in inter-row spaces, avoiding tree contact):**
        These kill all green vegetation they come into contact with.
        *   **Glyphosate 41% SL:** Apply at 5-7.5 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray.
        *   **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL:** Apply at 2-4 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray.
        *   **Glufosinate-ammonium 13.5% SL:** Apply at 3.7-7.4 L/acre in 200-300 L of water. Use as a directed spray.

    *   **Selective Herbicides (for specific weed types):**
        *   **For Narrowleaf Weeds (Grasses like Phalaris minor):**
            *   **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC:** Apply at 1-2 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.
            *   **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC:** Apply at 0.55-1.1 L/acre in 200-300 L of water.

**3. Specific Weed Management Strategies:**

*   **Amarbail (Cuscuta spp.):**
    *   **Manual Removal:** This is the most effective method. Remove infested plant parts or entire host plants before the Amarbail sets seed.
    *   **Pre-emergence:** **Pendimethalin 30% EC** can help prevent the germination of Amarbail seeds.
    *   **Spot Treatment:** Very careful spot application of **Glyphosate 41% SL** can be used on heavily infested patches, ensuring no contact with the almond tree.

*   **Bathu (Chenopodium album) & Congress grass (Parthenium hysterophorus):**
    These are broadleaf weeds. They can be effectively controlled by:
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin 30% EC** or **Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC**.
    *   Post-emergence application of non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate 41% SL**, **Paraquat dichloride 24% SL**, or **Glufosinate-ammonium 13.5% SL** as directed sprays.

*   **Phalaris minor:**
    This is a narrowleaf (grass) weed. It can be controlled by:
    *   Pre-emergence application of **Pendimethalin 30% EC**.
    *   Post-emergence application of selective graminicides like **Quizalofop-ethyl 5% EC** or **Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 9% EC**.
    *   Non-selective herbicides like **Glyphosate 41% SL** can also be used as a directed spray.

Always read and follow the label instructions of the specific herbicide product for safe and effective application. Ensure proper safety gear is used during application.
