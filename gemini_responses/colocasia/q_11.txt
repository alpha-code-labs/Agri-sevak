As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Colocasia (Arvi/Ghuiyan) in Haryana.

### Sawflies

This is not known to affect Colocasia.

### Beetles and Weevils

Beetles (e.g., leaf beetles like *Lema* spp., flea beetles) and weevils (which are a type of beetle, some of which can damage corms or leaves) can be pests of Colocasia. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and judicious use of chemical control when necessary.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Monitoring:** Regularly inspect your Colocasia plants, especially the undersides of leaves and around the base, for adult beetles, weevils, their larvae, or signs of feeding damage (holes, defoliation, scraping). Early detection is key.
2.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering sites for pests.
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Colocasia with non-host crops to break pest cycles.
    *   **Weed Management:** Control weeds in and around the field, as they can serve as alternate hosts for some pests.
    *   **Healthy Plants:** Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to promote vigorous plant growth, which can better tolerate minor pest damage.

**Chemical Control (Use only when pest incidence crosses economic threshold):**

When chemical intervention is required, choose CIBRC-approved insecticides and follow the label instructions carefully for dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

For foliar-feeding beetles and weevils:

*   **Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
*   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at a rate of 0.3 ml per litre of water (approximately 150 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).
*   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of 0.5 ml per litre of water (approximately 250 ml per acre in 500 litres of water).

For soil-dwelling weevils or root-feeding beetles (if corm damage is observed and attributed to these pests):

*   **Chlorpyrifos 20% EC:** Apply as a drench around the base of the plants at a rate of 4 ml per litre of water (approximately 2 litres per acre in 500 litres of water).
*   **Fipronil 5% SC:** Apply as a drench around the base of the plants at a rate of 2 ml per litre of water (approximately 1 litre per acre in 500 litres of water).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rotation of Chemicals:** To prevent the development of pesticide resistance, rotate insecticides with different modes of action.
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
*   **Safety:** Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   **Consult Local Experts:** For specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current pest pressure, it is always advisable to consult with your local agricultural extension officer or HAU experts.
