As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling the mentioned conditions in Colocasia, keeping in mind the specific context of Haryana, India:

### Control of Scab in Colocasia

Scab in Colocasia is primarily caused by fungal pathogens, such as *Sphaceloma* species, leading to characteristic lesions on leaves, petioles, and corms. Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and chemical interventions.

**Cultural Practices:**
*   Use disease-free planting material.
*   Practice crop rotation to reduce pathogen inoculum in the soil.
*   Ensure proper plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
*   Remove and destroy infected plant debris to prevent disease spread.

**Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For chemical control, apply fungicides as a foliar spray at the first sign of symptoms and repeat as necessary, typically at 10-15 day intervals, depending on disease severity and weather conditions.

*   **Mancozeb**: Apply at a concentration of 2.5 grams per litre of water.
*   **Copper oxychloride**: Apply at a concentration of 3 grams per litre of water.
*   **Carbendazim + Mancozeb** (combination product): Apply at a concentration of 2 grams per litre of water.

### Canker in Colocasia

This is not known to affect Colocasia. Canker is typically a disease of woody plants and fruit trees, characterized by localized necrosis of bark and cambium.

### Gummosis in Colocasia

This is not known to affect Colocasia. Gummosis is a pathological condition primarily observed in woody plants, particularly fruit trees, where gum exudes from the bark, often in response to stress, injury, or disease. Colocasia, being a herbaceous plant, does not exhibit gummosis.

### Lichen in Colocasia

Lichens are symbiotic organisms (a fungus and an alga) that grow on surfaces such as tree bark, rocks, and sometimes on the older, less active parts of herbaceous plants in humid environments. They are generally epiphytic and non-parasitic, meaning they do not derive nutrients from the plant and do not cause any direct harm or damage to Colocasia. Therefore, control measures for lichens are typically not required or recommended for Colocasia. Their presence usually indicates good air quality and a humid environment.
