As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for controlling soil pests like termites and root-knot nematodes in Colocasia. This involves a combination of cultural, biological, and judicious chemical methods to ensure sustainable and effective control.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles:
*   **Proper Diagnosis:** Confirm the presence and severity of the pest problem.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove crop residues and weeds that can harbor pests.
*   **Soil Health:** Maintain good soil health through organic matter addition and proper irrigation.
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Colocasia with non-host crops to break pest cycles.
*   **Judicious Chemical Use:** Apply chemicals only when necessary and strictly follow recommended dosages and safety precautions.

### 1. Termite Control in Colocasia

Termites (e.g., *Odontotermes obesus*, *Microtermes obesi*) can cause significant damage by feeding on tubers and roots, leading to wilting and reduced yield.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Field Preparation:** Deep ploughing during summer exposes termites to heat and predators.
*   **Residue Management:** Remove all crop residues, stubble, and woody debris from the field before planting.
*   **Irrigation:** Maintain adequate soil moisture, as termites prefer dry conditions.
*   **Organic Matter:** Avoid burying undecomposed organic matter directly in the field, which can attract termites.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Entomopathogenic Fungi:** Soil application of *Metarhizium anisopliae* (1-2 kg per acre mixed with 100 kg farmyard manure) can help suppress termite populations.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
For severe infestations, chemical control can be employed. Apply chemicals as a pre-planting treatment or at the time of planting/earthing up.
*   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: Apply 2.5 litres per acre mixed in 500 litres of water as a soil drench at the time of planting or during earthing up.
*   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of planting or during earthing up.

### 2. Nematode (Root-Knot) Control in Colocasia

Root-knot nematodes (*Meloidogyne* spp.) are a major threat, causing galls on roots and corms, leading to stunted growth, nutrient deficiency symptoms, and significant yield reduction.

**A. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Colocasia with non-host crops like cereals (e.g., maize, sorghum, wheat) for at least 2-3 years to reduce nematode populations.
*   **Solarization:** During fallow periods in summer, cover the moist soil with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks to heat the soil and kill nematodes.
*   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for Haryana conditions, use nematode-resistant Colocasia varieties.
*   **Healthy Planting Material:** Use only nematode-free corms/cormels for planting.

**B. Biological Control:**
*   **Organic Amendments:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost (10-15 tonnes per acre) and **Neem cake** (200-400 kg per acre) into the soil 2-3 weeks before planting. Neem cake acts as a bio-nematicide and promotes beneficial soil microbes.
*   **Bio-nematicides:** Apply formulations of *Purpureocillium lilacinum* (formerly *Paecilomyces lilacinus*) or *Trichoderma harzianum* (2-4 kg per acre mixed with 100 kg FYM) at the time of planting.

**C. Chemical Control (CIBRC Approved):**
Chemical nematicides can be used for effective control, especially in heavily infested fields.
*   **Carbofuran** 3% G: Apply 10-15 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of planting or during earthing up.
*   **Fluensulfone** 2% GR: Apply 10 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of planting.
*   **Phorate** 10% G: Apply 4 kg per acre by broadcasting and mixing into the soil at the time of planting or during earthing up. (Note: Phorate is highly toxic; handle with extreme care and follow all safety guidelines).

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during chemical application.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension officers for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions and the latest approved practices.
