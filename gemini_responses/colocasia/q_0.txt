As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling fungal diseases in Colocasia (Arvi/Ghuiyan) in Haryana.

**General Management Principles for Fungal Diseases in Colocasia:**

Before discussing specific diseases, it is crucial to adopt an Integrated Disease Management (IDM) approach, which includes:

1.  **Resistant Varieties:** Where available and suitable for local conditions, choose disease-resistant or tolerant Colocasia varieties.
2.  **Healthy Planting Material:** Always use disease-free corms or cormels for planting.
3.  **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris, weeds, and volunteer plants that can harbor pathogens.
4.  **Proper Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing to ensure good air circulation within the canopy, which reduces humidity and fungal growth.
5.  **Water Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day, as prolonged leaf wetness promotes fungal diseases. Drip irrigation is preferable.
6.  **Nutrient Management:** Provide balanced nutrition. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can lead to lush, susceptible growth.
7.  **Crop Rotation:** Rotate Colocasia with non-host crops to break the disease cycle in the soil.

Here's how to control the specific fungal conditions you've mentioned:

### 1. Alternaria Leaf Spot (Caused by *Alternaria* spp.)

This disease causes small, circular to irregular brown spots on leaves, often with concentric rings, leading to premature defoliation.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Practice good field sanitation and ensure proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0 kg/acre).
    *   Alternatively, spray with **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
    *   For systemic action, **Propiconazole** at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre) can be used.
    *   **Azoxystrobin** at 0.5 ml/L of water (or 200 ml/acre) is also effective.

### 2. Anthracnose (Caused by *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*)

Anthracnose appears as dark, sunken lesions on leaves, petioles, and corms, often with a water-soaked margin. In severe cases, it can cause significant defoliation and corm rot.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Remove and destroy infected plant parts. Ensure good drainage.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Carbendazim** at 0.5 g/L of water (or 200 g/acre).
    *   Alternatively, use **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0 kg/acre).
    *   A combination of **Carbendazim + Mancozeb** (readymix formulation) can be used at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
    *   **Tebuconazole** at 0.75 ml/L of water (or 300 ml/acre) is also effective.

### 3. Blast

This is not known to affect Colocasia.

### 4. Blight (Phytophthora Blight and Cercospora Leaf Blight)

**Phytophthora Blight (Caused by *Phytophthora colocasiae*)** is the most destructive disease of Colocasia, causing large, water-soaked lesions on leaves that rapidly expand, leading to complete blighting and corm rot.
**Cercospora Leaf Blight (Caused by *Cercospora colocasiae*)** causes small, angular, brown spots on leaves, often surrounded by a yellow halo, which can coalesce to form larger blighted areas.

**Control Measures for Blight:**

*   **Cultural:** Use resistant varieties if available. Ensure good drainage and avoid waterlogging. Remove and destroy infected leaves immediately.
*   **Chemical (for Phytophthora Blight - Oomycete):**
    *   Start prophylactic sprays during humid weather.
    *   **Metalaxyl-M + Mancozeb** (readymix formulation) at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
    *   Alternatively, **Dimethomorph + Mancozeb** (readymix formulation) at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
    *   **Propamocarb hydrochloride** at 3.0 ml/L of water (or 1.2 L/acre).
    *   **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb** (readymix formulation) at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
*   **Chemical (for Cercospora Leaf Blight - True Fungus):**
    *   **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0 kg/acre).
    *   **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5 g/L of water (or 200 g/acre).
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3.0 g/L of water (or 1.2 kg/acre) can also be used as a protectant.

### 5. Brown Spot (Often caused by *Cercospora colocasiae* or *Phyllosticta colocasiae*)

Brown spot is a general term for various leaf spot diseases. *Cercospora leaf spot* is a common cause, as described under Blight. *Phyllosticta leaf spot* also causes circular to irregular brown spots, often with a purplish margin.

**Control Measures:**

*   **Cultural:** Maintain field hygiene and proper plant spacing.
*   **Chemical:**
    *   Foliar spray with **Mancozeb** at 2.5 g/L of water (or 1.0 kg/acre).
    *   Alternatively, **Chlorothalonil** at 2.0 g/L of water (or 800 g/acre).
    *   **Carbendazim** at 0.5 g/L of water (or 200 g/acre) is effective against many leaf spot fungi.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** at 3.0 g/L of water (or 1.2 kg/acre) can be used as a protectant.

### 6. Downy Mildew / Powdery Mildew

This is not known to affect Colocasia.

### 7. Grey Mildew

This is not known to affect Colocasia.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Always read and follow the instructions on the fungicide label for correct dosage, application method, and safety precautions.
*   Rotate fungicides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance in pathogens.
*   Consult with local agricultural extension services or HAU experts for specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and current disease pressure.
