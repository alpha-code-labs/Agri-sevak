As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified seed (corm/cormel) and soil treatment processes for Colocasia cultivation in Haryana:

Colocasia is propagated by corms or cormels, not true seeds. Therefore, "seed treatment" refers to the pre-planting treatment of these corms/cormels to protect them from soil-borne pathogens and early-stage pests.

### Seed Treatment (Corm/Cormel Treatment)

This process aims to protect the planting material from fungal diseases and nematodes right from the start.

*   **For Fungal Diseases (e.g., Corm Rot, Damping-off):**
    *   Dip the corms/cormels in a solution of **Carbendazim** 1 g/L of water for 30 minutes.
    *   Alternatively, use **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L of water for 30 minutes.
    *   Allow the treated corms/cormels to air dry in the shade before planting.
    *   For an integrated approach, treat corms with a biological fungicide like **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** at 10 g/kg of corms. Mix the bio-agent with a small amount of water to form a slurry and coat the corms evenly.

*   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
    *   Treat corms with a biological nematicide such as **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or **Purpureocillium lilacinum**) at 10 g/kg of corms as a slurry treatment. This helps in reducing initial nematode populations.

*   **For Early Insect Pests (e.g., Sucking Pests):**
    *   If early season sucking pest pressure is anticipated, corms can be treated with **Imidacloprid** 70 WS at 5-7 g/kg of corms as a slurry treatment. This provides systemic protection during the initial growth phase.

### Soil Treatment

Soil treatment is crucial for managing soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and weeds, thereby creating a conducive environment for healthy corm development and yield.

*   **For Soil-borne Fungal Diseases (e.g., Sclerotium Rot, Pythium Rot):**
    *   **Before planting:** Incorporate well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) enriched with **Trichoderma viride** or **Trichoderma harzianum** (2.5 kg of bio-agent mixed with 50 kg FYM) per acre into the soil during land preparation.
    *   **At planting/drench:** If there is a history of high disease incidence, drench the soil around the planting pits with **Carbendazim** 1 g/L of water or **Mancozeb** 2.5 g/L of water. This can be done immediately after planting or at the first sign of disease.

*   **For Nematodes (e.g., Root-knot nematodes):**
    *   **At planting:** Apply **Carbofuran** 3G granules at 10 kg/acre or **Phorate** 10G granules at 4 kg/acre in the soil at the time of planting, near the corms. Ensure proper incorporation into the soil and follow with irrigation.
    *   Alternatively, incorporate **Paecilomyces lilacinus** (or **Purpureocillium lilacinum**) at 2.5 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg FYM into the soil before planting.

*   **For Weed Management (Pre-emergence):**
    *   **After planting but before weed emergence:** Apply **Pendimethalin** 30% EC at 1.0-1.25 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 3.3-4.1 L of product/acre) as a pre-emergence spray within 2-3 days of planting. Ensure adequate soil moisture for optimal efficacy.
    *   Alternatively, **Oxyfluorfen** 23.5% EC at 0.2-0.25 kg a.i./acre (equivalent to 0.85-1.0 L of product/acre) can be used as a pre-emergence spray.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the label instructions of any chemical or biological product before use. Ensure proper safety measures are taken during handling and application. Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) approaches, combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods, are highly recommended for sustainable Colocasia cultivation.
