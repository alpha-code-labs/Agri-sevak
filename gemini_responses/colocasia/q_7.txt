As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm the following regarding the diseases you've mentioned for Colocasia:

*   **Dieback:** This is not known to affect Colocasia. Dieback is typically a condition affecting woody plants, leading to the death of shoots and branches from the tip inwards. Colocasia is a herbaceous plant and does not exhibit this specific disease.
*   **Twig blight:** This is not known to affect Colocasia. Twig blight affects the twigs of woody plants, which Colocasia does not possess.
*   **Tikka disease:** This is not known to affect Colocasia. Tikka disease is a common name for leaf spot diseases primarily affecting groundnut (peanut). Colocasia has its own specific leaf spot diseases, but "Tikka disease" is not one of them.

For Colocasia, common diseases include Phytophthora blight (leaf blight), various leaf spots (e.g., caused by *Cercospora* or *Phyllosticta* species), and corm rots. If you are observing symptoms like leaf spots, wilting, or corm decay, please provide more details or images for accurate diagnosis and control recommendations.
