As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach for effective control of sucking pests like Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips in Colocasia (Arvi) in Haryana. This approach combines cultural, biological, and judicious chemical control measures.

**1. Cultural Practices:**
*   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, to detect pest infestations early.
*   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as they can serve as alternate hosts for these pests.
*   **Proper Spacing:** Ensure adequate plant spacing to improve air circulation and reduce humidity, which can discourage pest build-up.
*   **Nutrient and Water Management:** Maintain optimal plant health through balanced fertilization and timely irrigation, as stressed plants are more susceptible to pest attacks.
*   **Yellow Sticky Traps:** Install yellow sticky traps (10-15 traps per acre) to monitor and mass-trap adult whiteflies, leafhoppers, and thrips.

**2. Biological Control:**
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Protect and encourage beneficial insects such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, hoverfly larvae, and parasitic wasps (e.g., *Encarsia formosa* for whiteflies), which naturally prey on or parasitize these sucking pests. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial organisms.

**3. Chemical Control:**
When pest populations reach economic threshold levels and cultural/biological methods are insufficient, the following CIBRC-approved technical chemicals can be used. Always ensure thorough spray coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves where these pests often reside. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of pest resistance.

*   For Aphids, Leafhoppers, Whiteflies, and Thrips:
    *   **Imidacloprid** 17.8% SL at 0.5-0.75 ml/L of water.
    *   **Thiamethoxam** 25% WG at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Acetamiprid** 20% SP at 0.2-0.4 g/L of water.
    *   **Flonicamid** 50% WG at 0.3 g/L of water (effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Pymetrozine** 50% WG at 0.3-0.4 g/L of water (highly effective against aphids and whiteflies).
    *   **Diafenthiuron** 50% WP at 1.25 g/L of water (effective against whiteflies, thrips, and mites).
    *   **Buprofezin** 25% SC at 1.25 ml/L of water (primarily targets whitefly nymphs and hoppers).

**Regarding Psylla:**
This is not known to affect Colocasia.

**Important Note:** Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label, including dosage, application method, safety precautions, and pre-harvest interval (PHI). For specific local recommendations, consult your nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or agricultural extension officer.
