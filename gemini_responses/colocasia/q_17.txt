As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following doses of organic manures and bio-stimulants for Colocasia cultivation in Haryana to enhance soil health, nutrient availability, and crop productivity:

1.  **Farmyard Manure (FYM):**
    *   Apply **20-25 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, at least 2-3 weeks before planting. Ensure the FYM is well-decomposed to avoid nutrient immobilization and pest issues.

2.  **Vermicompost:**
    *   Apply **2-3 tonnes per acre** during land preparation, either alone or in conjunction with a reduced quantity of FYM. Vermicompost provides readily available nutrients and improves soil structure.

3.  **Sagarika (Seaweed Extract):**
    *   **Granular Form (Soil Application):** Apply **8-10 kg per acre** at the time of planting or within 30 days of planting, mixed with soil or other fertilizers.
    *   **Liquid Form (Foliar Spray):**
        *   First spray: 30-45 days after planting.
        *   Second spray: 15-20 days after the first spray.
        *   Dose: **2-3 ml per litre of water**. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

These organic inputs contribute significantly to sustainable Colocasia production by improving soil organic matter, microbial activity, and nutrient use efficiency.
