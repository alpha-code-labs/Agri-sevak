Namaste! As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I understand your concern regarding wilt in Colocasia, which can significantly impact yield. Wilt, including what is sometimes referred to as "Parawilt," is a complex symptom often caused by various soil-borne fungal and bacterial pathogens leading to root rot and vascular wilting. Effective management requires an integrated approach.

Here's a scientifically verified approach for controlling wilt in Colocasia in Haryana:

**I. Cultural and Agronomic Practices (Prevention and Management):**
These practices are crucial for preventing and managing wilt diseases, as chemical control alone is often insufficient for soil-borne pathogens.

*   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting Colocasia or other susceptible crops (like brinjal, tomato, potato, chilli) in the same field for at least 3-4 years. Rotate with non-host crops like cereals (wheat, maize) or legumes.
*   **Use Disease-Free Planting Material:** Always select healthy, disease-free corms/cormels for planting. Inspect them thoroughly for any signs of rot or discoloration.
*   **Soil Solarization:** In summer, after harvesting the previous crop, plough the field, irrigate it, and then cover it with transparent polyethylene sheets for 4-6 weeks. This raises soil temperature, effectively killing many soil-borne pathogens, including those causing wilt.
*   **Improve Soil Drainage:** Waterlogging creates anaerobic conditions that favor many root rot pathogens. Ensure proper drainage in your fields. Raised beds can be beneficial in areas prone to waterlogging.
*   **Field Sanitation:** Remove and destroy all infected plant debris, including wilted plants, from the field to reduce the inoculum load.
*   **Balanced Nutrition:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can make plants more susceptible. Provide balanced nutrients based on soil test recommendations.
*   **Water Management:** Practice judicious irrigation. Avoid over-irrigation, especially during the early stages of crop growth.
*   **Deep Ploughing:** During summer, deep ploughing can expose soil-borne pathogens to direct sunlight, reducing their viability.

**II. Chemical Control (As a supplement to cultural practices):**

Chemical treatments can be effective when used preventively or at the very early stages of disease onset.

**A. Corm Treatment (Before Planting):**
Treating corms before planting helps protect them from initial infection by soil-borne pathogens.

*   For fungal pathogens (e.g., *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*, *Rhizoctonia*):
    *   Dip corms in a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 2 grams per litre of water for 30 minutes.
    *   Alternatively, treat corms with **Thiram** 75% WS at 2-3 grams per kilogram of corms.
*   For Oomycete pathogens (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*) which often cause root rot leading to wilt:
    *   Dip corms in a solution of **Metalaxyl-M** 31.8% ES at 3 ml per litre of water for 30 minutes.

**B. Soil Drenching (After Planting / At First Symptom):**
If wilt symptoms appear in the field, drenching the soil around the base of the plants can help.

*   For fungal wilts (e.g., *Fusarium*, *Sclerotium*, *Rhizoctonia*):
    *   Drench the soil around the base of affected plants with a solution of **Carbendazim** 50% WP at 1-2 grams per litre of water. Apply approximately 200-500 ml of solution per plant, depending on plant size.
    *   If *Rhizoctonia* is suspected (often causing collar rot leading to wilt), drench with **Validamycin** 3% L at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
*   For Oomycete-induced root rots (e.g., *Pythium*, *Phytophthora*):
    *   Drench the soil around the base of plants with **Metalaxyl** 8% + **Mancozeb** 64% WP at 2 grams per litre of water.
    *   Alternatively, use **Propamocarb hydrochloride** 72.2% SL at 2-3 ml per litre of water.
    *   Another option is **Fosetyl-aluminium** 80% WP at 2-3 grams per litre of water.
*   For Bacterial Wilt (*Ralstonia solanacearum*):
    *   Chemical control for bacterial wilt in soil is generally less effective than cultural methods. However, as a supportive measure, you may drench the soil around the base of plants with a solution of **Streptomycin sulfate** 9% + **Tetracycline hydrochloride** 1% SP at 0.5-1 gram per litre of water.
    *   **Copper Oxychloride** 50% WP at 2-3 grams per litre of water can also be used as a drench, as it possesses some bactericidal properties.

Remember to always read and follow the instructions on the product label for safe and effective use of any chemical. For specific recommendations tailored to your farm, it is advisable to get a soil test and, if possible, a diagnosis of the specific pathogen causing the wilt.
