As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following fertilizer schedule for Colocasia (Arvi/Ghuiyan) in Haryana. These recommendations are based on scientific research and aim to optimize yield and quality.

**General NPK Recommendation for Colocasia:**
For optimal growth and tuber development, a general recommendation of **100 kg Nitrogen (N), 80 kg Phosphorus (P2O5), and 100 kg Potassium (K2O) per acre** is advised. Additionally, Sulphur is crucial for Colocasia.

**Important Note:** For precise recommendations, it is always advisable to conduct a soil test of your field. The doses mentioned below are general guidelines for soils with average fertility.

**Recommended Doses of Fertilizers:**

**1. Nitrogen (N):**
*   **Source:** **Urea** (46% N)
*   **Total Dose:** 150 kg/acre
*   **Application Timing:** Apply in three split doses:
    *   **Basal Application (at planting):** 50 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **First Top-dressing (30-45 days after planting):** 50 kg **Urea** per acre.
    *   **Second Top-dressing (60-75 days after planting):** 50 kg **Urea** per acre.

**2. Phosphorus (P2O5):**
*   **Source:** **Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)** (18% N, 46% P2O5)
*   **Total Dose:** 175 kg/acre
*   **Application Timing:** Apply the full dose as **basal application** at the time of planting.
    *   *(This dose of DAP will also contribute approximately 31.5 kg N per acre, which has been accounted for in the Urea recommendation.)*
*   **Alternative Source:** If **Single Super Phosphate (SSP)** (16% P2O5, 11% S) is preferred, apply 500 kg **SSP** per acre as basal. This will provide 80 kg P2O5 and approximately 55 kg Sulphur, eliminating the need for separate Sulphur application. In this case, the Urea dose would need to be adjusted to provide the full 100 kg N, as SSP does not contain N.

**3. Potassium (K2O):**
*   **Source:** **Muriate of Potash (Potassium Chloride)** (60% K2O)
*   **Total Dose:** 165-170 kg/acre
*   **Application Timing:** Apply the full dose as **basal application** at the time of planting.

**4. Sulphur (S):**
*   **Source:** **Elemental Sulphur (90% S)**
*   **Total Dose:** 25-30 kg/acre
*   **Application Timing:** Apply the full dose as **basal application** at the time of planting.
    *   *(If SSP is used as the Phosphorus source, separate Sulphur application may not be required as SSP provides sufficient Sulphur.)*

**5. Nano-Urea:**
*   **Source:** **Nano Urea Liquid** (4% N)
*   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per liter of water (typically 250-500 ml per acre per spray).
*   **Application Timing:** Foliar spray. Two sprays are recommended:
    *   **First Spray:** At active vegetative growth stage (e.g., 30-40 days after planting).
    *   **Second Spray:** 20-30 days after the first spray.
*   **Note:** Nano-Urea is a supplementary source of Nitrogen and can help in reducing the requirement of conventional **Urea** by up to 50% when integrated into the nutrient management plan.

**6. Nano-DAP:**
*   **Source:** **Nano DAP Liquid** (8% N, 16% P2O5)
*   **Dose:** 2-4 ml per liter of water (typically 250-500 ml per acre per spray).
*   **Application Timing:** Foliar spray. Two sprays are recommended:
    *   **First Spray:** At tuber initiation stage (e.g., 45-60 days after planting).
    *   **Second Spray:** 20-30 days after the first spray.
*   **Note:** Nano-DAP is a supplementary source of Phosphorus and Nitrogen and can help in reducing the requirement of conventional **DAP** by up to 50% when integrated into the nutrient management plan.

**7. NPK (Complex Fertilizers):**
*   If a complex NPK fertilizer is preferred, ensure that the total amount of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P2O5), and Potassium (K2O) supplied through the complex fertilizer aligns with the recommended doses of 100 kg N, 80 kg P2O5, and 100 kg K2O per acre. Adjustments with individual fertilizers (Urea, Muriate of Potash) may be necessary to meet the specific nutrient requirements at different growth stages.

Always ensure uniform application of fertilizers and adequate soil moisture for efficient nutrient uptake.
