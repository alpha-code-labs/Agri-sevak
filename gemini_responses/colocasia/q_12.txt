Control of Scale insects and Mealybugs in Colocasia requires an integrated approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods. These pests are sap-suckers that can significantly reduce yield and plant vigor by extracting plant sap and excreting honeydew, which promotes sooty mold growth.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants for early signs of infestation, especially on the undersides of leaves and in leaf axils.
    *   Prune and destroy heavily infested leaves or plant parts to reduce pest populations.
    *   Maintain good field sanitation by removing weeds, which can harbor these pests.
    *   Avoid excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers, as lush, soft growth can attract sucking pests.
    *   Ensure proper plant spacing for good air circulation, which can deter pest establishment.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Encourage natural enemies such as ladybird beetles, lacewings, and parasitic wasps, which prey on or parasitize scale insects and mealybugs. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.

3.  **Chemical Control:**
    *   For effective chemical control, thorough coverage of the plant, especially the undersides of leaves and leaf axils where these pests often hide, is crucial. Systemic insecticides are often preferred due to their ability to move within the plant tissue.
    *   Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of resistance.

    **Recommended CIBRC-approved insecticides for Scale insects and Mealybugs in Colocasia (Foliar Spray):**

    *   **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** Apply at a rate of **0.5 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**.
    *   **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** Apply at a rate of **0.2 - 0.4 g per litre of water**.
    *   **Buprofezin 25% SC:** Apply at a rate of **1.25 - 1.5 ml per litre of water**. (Note: Buprofezin is an Insect Growth Regulator, primarily effective against nymphs and has a slower action but good residual effect).
    *   **Spirotetramat 150 OD:** Apply at a rate of **0.75 - 1.0 ml per litre of water**. (Note: This is a two-way systemic insecticide, providing excellent control of hidden pests).

    **Important Considerations for Chemical Application:**
    *   Always read and follow the label instructions carefully before mixing and applying any pesticide.
    *   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application.
    *   Apply insecticides during cooler parts of the day (early morning or late evening) to minimize drift and maximize efficacy.
    *   Ensure proper spray volume to achieve thorough coverage without runoff.
    *   Observe the pre-harvest interval (PHI) specified on the product label before harvesting Colocasia corms or leaves for consumption.
