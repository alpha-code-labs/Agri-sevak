As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following cultivation practices for Colocasia in Haryana:

*   **Sowing Method/Pattern:**
    *   Colocasia is propagated vegetatively using corms or cormels (small corms). It is not typically grown from true seeds.
    *   The planting material (corms/cormels) should be healthy, disease-free, and preferably from the previous season's crop.
    *   Planting is usually done in rows, either on flat beds or ridges, depending on soil type and irrigation method. For heavy soils or areas prone to waterlogging, planting on ridges is often preferred.

*   **Planting Depth:**
    *   Plant corms/cormels at a depth of **5-10 cm**. Ensure the growing point (bud) is facing upwards.

*   **Spacing:**
    *   Optimal spacing is crucial for good yield and corm development.
    *   **Row-to-row spacing:** **45-60 cm**
    *   **Plant-to-plant spacing:** **30-45 cm**
    *   Closer spacing (e.g., 45 cm x 30 cm) can result in higher total yield but smaller cormels, while wider spacing (e.g., 60 cm x 45 cm) may produce larger corms.

*   **Seed Dose (Planting Material Requirement):**
    *   The quantity of corms/cormels required depends on their size and the chosen spacing.
    *   Generally, a seed rate of **800-1200 kg per acre** of healthy corms/cormels is recommended. This typically translates to approximately **30,000 to 45,000 corms/cormels per acre**, depending on their average weight and the specific spacing adopted.
