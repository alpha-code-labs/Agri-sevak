This is not known to affect Colocasia.

Fruit flies (Tephritidae family) are primarily pests of fruits, and Colocasia is cultivated for its corms and leaves, not its fruit. Similarly, the Ber fly (Carpomyia vesuviana) is a highly specific pest of Ber (Indian Jujube) fruits and does not infest Colocasia.

If you are observing any fly-like insects on your Colocasia plants, they are likely not fruit flies or Ber flies causing significant damage. For common pests of Colocasia in Haryana, such as aphids, leaf folders, or mites, please provide details, and I can offer appropriate control measures.
