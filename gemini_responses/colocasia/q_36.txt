As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I recommend the following scientifically verified practices to improve yield, corm quality, and storage life for Colocasia (Arvi) in Haryana:

### Improving Yield for Colocasia

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties suitable for the agro-climatic conditions of Haryana. Consult local HAU extension centers for recommended varieties.
2.  **Soil Management:**
    *   Conduct a soil test to determine nutrient status and pH. Colocasia thrives in well-drained, fertile loamy soils with a pH range of 5.5-7.0.
    *   Incorporate 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost per acre during land preparation to improve soil structure and fertility.
    *   Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which is detrimental to corm development.
3.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Apply fertilizers based on soil test recommendations. A general recommendation for Colocasia in Haryana is 80-100 kg Nitrogen, 60 kg Phosphorus, and 80-100 kg Potassium per acre.
        *   Apply full Phosphorus (as **Diammonium Phosphate** or **Single Super Phosphate**) and Potassium (as **Muriate of Potash**) along with half Nitrogen (as **Urea**) as a basal dose at planting.
        *   Apply the remaining half Nitrogen (as **Urea**) in two equal splits, 45 and 90 days after planting, as top dressing.
    *   If soil tests indicate micronutrient deficiencies, apply **Zinc Sulphate** (10 kg/acre) or **Borax** (2 kg/acre) as needed.
4.  **Water Management:**
    *   Provide regular and adequate irrigation, especially during critical growth stages like corm initiation and development.
    *   Maintain consistent soil moisture without causing waterlogging. Typically, irrigate every 7-10 days depending on soil type and weather conditions.
5.  **Weed Management:**
    *   Control weeds effectively, particularly during the first 60-90 days after planting, as they compete heavily for nutrients and light.
    *   Perform 2-3 manual weedings and earthing up operations.
    *   For chemical weed control, apply pre-emergence herbicide **Pendimethalin** at 1.0 kg active ingredient per acre within 3 days of planting.
6.  **Planting Density:**
    *   Plant corms at an optimal spacing of 45-60 cm between rows and 30-45 cm between plants within a row, depending on the variety, to ensure proper corm development and maximize yield.

### Improving Fruit Quality (Corm Quality) for Colocasia

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Choose varieties known for desirable traits such as good taste, texture, cooking quality, and low acridity.
2.  **Nutrient Management:**
    *   Adequate application of Potassium (as **Muriate of Potash**) is crucial for starch synthesis, improving corm size, and overall quality.
    *   Balanced nutrition prevents physiological disorders that can negatively affect corm quality.
3.  **Water Management:**
    *   Consistent moisture supply throughout the growing season prevents corm cracking and ensures uniform development. Avoid extreme fluctuations in soil moisture.
4.  **Timely Harvesting:**
    *   Harvest corms at physiological maturity (usually 7-9 months after planting, depending on the variety) when the leaves start turning yellow and drying. Harvesting too early results in small, immature corms, while delayed harvesting can lead to fibrous corms or increased pest/disease incidence.
5.  **Pest and Disease Control:**
    *   Effective management of pests and diseases (e.g., leaf blight, corm rot, aphids) prevents direct damage to foliage and corms, thereby improving their quality.

### Improving Storage Life for Colocasia

1.  **Variety Selection:**
    *   Select varieties that are known to have good inherent storability.
2.  **Harvesting Practices:**
    *   Harvest corms carefully to minimize mechanical damage (cuts, bruises, abrasions), as these are primary entry points for pathogens causing spoilage.
    *   Avoid harvesting during wet conditions, as this can increase the risk of post-harvest rot.
3.  **Curing:**
    *   After harvest, cure the corms for 7-10 days in a well-ventilated, shaded area at ambient temperature (25-30°C) and high humidity (85-90%). Curing helps heal wounds, toughen the skin, and reduce moisture loss, significantly extending storage life.
4.  **Pre-storage Sorting:**
    *   Carefully sort out any damaged, diseased, or immature corms before storage. Only healthy, mature corms should be stored.
5.  **Storage Conditions:**
    *   Store corms in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place, ideally at a temperature of 10-15°C and a relative humidity of 75-85%.
    *   Avoid direct sunlight and extreme temperature fluctuations.
    *   Store corms in single layers or in well-ventilated crates/baskets to ensure good air circulation and prevent heat buildup.
    *   Regularly inspect stored corms and promptly remove any showing signs of spoilage to prevent the spread of rot.
