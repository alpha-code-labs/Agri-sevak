As a Senior Agronomist at HAU, Hisar, I recommend the following scientifically verified practices for Colocasia cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Ideal Transplantation Time:**
*   The primary planting season for Colocasia in Haryana is during the monsoon, typically from **June to July**. This timing allows the crop to benefit from the monsoon rains.
*   For early crops, planting can also be done in **February to March** under assured irrigated conditions.

**2. Ideal Planting Distance:**
*   The optimal spacing depends on the variety and desired corm size. Generally, a spacing of **45 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants** is recommended.
*   For varieties that produce larger corms or for better aeration and light penetration, a wider spacing of **60 cm between rows and 45 cm between plants** can be adopted.

**3. Transplantation Process:**

*   **Land Preparation:**
    *   Plough the field thoroughly to a depth of **20-25 cm**, followed by 2-3 harrowing operations to achieve a fine, friable tilth.
    *   Incorporate **20-25 tonnes of well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or compost per hectare** during the last ploughing.
    *   Level the field properly to ensure uniform water distribution and drainage.

*   **Selection and Preparation of Planting Material:**
    *   Use healthy, disease-free cormels (side tubers) weighing **25-50 grams** each.
    *   Ensure each cormel has at least one healthy bud (eye).
    *   Avoid using cormels showing any signs of damage or disease.

*   **Planting Method:**
    *   Make shallow furrows or pits at the recommended spacing (e.g., 45 cm x 30 cm).
    *   Plant the cormels at a depth of **5-7 cm** with the bud facing upwards.
    *   Cover the cormels lightly with soil, ensuring good contact.

*   **Irrigation:**
    *   Immediately after planting, provide light irrigation if there is no imminent rainfall, especially for the February-March planting.
    *   Maintain adequate soil moisture, particularly during critical growth stages, but avoid waterlogging.

*   **Earthing Up:**
    *   Perform earthing up operations **2-3 times** during the crop cycle, starting about 45-60 days after planting. This practice helps in better corm development, provides support to the plants, and prevents greening of tubers exposed to sunlight.
