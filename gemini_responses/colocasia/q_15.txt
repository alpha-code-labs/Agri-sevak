Dear Farmer,

As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide you with scientifically verified advice for managing pests in Colocasia (Arvi) in Haryana.

Here's how to address the pests you've mentioned:

**1. Grasshopper**
Grasshoppers can cause significant defoliation by feeding on Colocasia leaves.
*   **Cultural/Mechanical Control:**
    *   Regular monitoring of fields to detect infestations early.
    *   Hand-picking and destroying grasshoppers, especially nymphs, in small areas.
    *   Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and destroy grasshopper eggs laid in the soil.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is severe):**
    *   **Malathion** 50% EC: 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water for spraying).
    *   **Quinalphos** 25% EC: 1.0 - 1.5 L per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water for spraying).
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 1.0 - 1.25 L per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water for spraying).
    *   **Fipronil** 5% SC: 400 - 600 ml per acre (mixed in 200-400 L of water for spraying).

**2. Painted Bug**
This is not known to affect Colocasia. Painted bugs are primarily pests of cruciferous crops (e.g., mustard, cabbage).

**3. Red Cotton Bug**
This is not known to affect Colocasia. Red cotton bugs are primarily pests of cotton and other malvaceous plants.

**4. Black Ants**
Black ants are generally not primary pests of Colocasia. They are often secondary pests, tending to other sap-sucking insects like aphids or mealybugs for their honeydew, or occasionally nesting near plants. If they are causing direct damage or facilitating other pests, control measures can be taken.
*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Maintain good field sanitation and remove weeds, which can harbor ants and other pests.
    *   If ants are tending other sucking pests, controlling the primary sucking pest will often reduce ant activity.
*   **Chemical Control (if necessary):**
    *   **Chlorpyrifos** 20% EC: 2.5 ml per liter of water for drenching ant nests or around the base of affected plants.
    *   **Fipronil** 0.3% GR: 5 - 10 kg per acre, applied as a soil treatment if ants are causing root damage or are a persistent nuisance.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always read and follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, application method, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).
*   Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during handling and application of chemicals.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for specific recommendations tailored to your field conditions.
