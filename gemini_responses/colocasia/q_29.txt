This is not known to affect Colocasia.

Colocasia (Arvi/Taro) is primarily cultivated for its underground corms and edible leaves, not for its flowers or fruits. Therefore, flower drop or fruit drop is not considered a significant issue requiring control measures in Colocasia cultivation. The term "Tinda/Boll dropping" is also not applicable to Colocasia.
