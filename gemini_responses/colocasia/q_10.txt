As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can provide the following scientifically verified advice for controlling pests in Colocasia (Arvi/Ghuiyan) in Haryana:

**1. Borers:**
While borers are not typically considered a major or common pest of Colocasia in Haryana, if you observe symptoms like wilting of central shoots, boreholes in stems, or tunneling, it could indicate the presence of a generalist stem borer.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants and remove and destroy any affected plant parts showing borer damage to prevent further spread.
    *   Maintain good field hygiene by removing plant debris.
*   **Chemical Control (if infestation is significant):**
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).
    *   **Flubendiamide 20% WG:** Apply at 0.25-0.3 g per litre of water (or 100-120 g per acre).

**2. Caterpillars (including Armyworms, Cutworms, and other leaf-eating caterpillars):**
Various species of caterpillars are common pests of Colocasia, causing significant defoliation by feeding on leaves.

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   Regularly inspect plants, especially the undersides of leaves, for egg masses and young larvae. Hand-pick and destroy them in the early stages of infestation.
    *   Maintain a weed-free field as weeds can harbor pests.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   Apply formulations of **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)**, a microbial insecticide, at recommended doses (e.g., 1-2 g/L or 400-800 g/acre) during the early larval stages for effective and eco-friendly control.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Spinosad 45% SC:** Apply at 0.16 ml per litre of water (or 64 ml per acre).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).

**3. Diamondback moth (*Plutella xylostella*):**
This is not known to affect Colocasia. Diamondback moth is primarily a pest of cruciferous crops like cabbage, cauliflower, and mustard.

**4. Leaf folder:**
Damage described as "leaf folder" in Colocasia is typically caused by various leaf-eating caterpillars that roll or fold leaves to feed and hide within. Therefore, the control measures for general caterpillars (as listed above) will be effective against leaf folders as well.

*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Emamectin benzoate 5% SG:** Apply at 0.2-0.25 g per litre of water (or 80-100 g per acre).
    *   **Indoxacarb 14.5% SC:** Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water (or 200 ml per acre).
    *   **Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC:** Apply at 0.3 ml per litre of water (or 60 ml per acre).

**General Recommendations:**
*   Always read and strictly follow the instructions on the pesticide label carefully, including dosage, timing, and safety precautions.
*   Ensure thorough spray coverage for effective control, especially on the undersides of leaves where pests often hide.
*   Rotate different classes of insecticides to prevent the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer or KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra) for specific advice tailored to your field conditions and the prevailing pest situation.
