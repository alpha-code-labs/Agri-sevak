As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I can confirm that both Red Spider Mite (primarily *Tetranychus urticae*) and Rust Mite (various eriophyid mites, including *Eriophyes colocasiae*) are known to affect Colocasia in Haryana, causing significant damage by sucking sap, leading to yellowing, bronzing, leaf distortion, and reduced yield.

Effective control requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, combining cultural practices with judicious use of CIBRC approved acaricides.

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Mites in Colocasia:

1.  **Cultural Practices:**
    *   **Regular Monitoring:** Frequently inspect the underside of Colocasia leaves for early signs of mites (tiny dots, webbing for spider mites, or bronzing/rusting for rust mites).
    *   **Weed Management:** Keep the field free of weeds, as many weeds can serve as alternate hosts for mites.
    *   **Proper Irrigation:** Ensure adequate soil moisture, as water stress can make plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Overhead irrigation or a strong jet of water can physically dislodge mites from leaves.
    *   **Crop Residue Removal:** After harvest, remove and destroy crop residues to reduce overwintering mite populations.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Maintain balanced plant nutrition. Excessive nitrogen can sometimes lead to lush growth that is more attractive to mites.

2.  **Biological Control:**
    *   Natural enemies like predatory mites (e.g., *Amblyseius* species) and certain ladybird beetles can help suppress mite populations. However, their effectiveness can be limited in severe outbreaks or when broad-spectrum insecticides are used.

3.  **Chemical Control (Acaricides):**
    *   When mite populations are high and causing economic damage, chemical control becomes necessary.
    *   **Thorough Coverage:** Mites primarily reside on the underside of leaves, so ensure that the spray solution thoroughly covers both surfaces of the leaves.
    *   **Rotation of Acaricides:** To prevent the development of resistance, rotate acaricides with different modes of action.
    *   **Adherence to Guidelines:** Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage, application timing, and pre-harvest interval (PHI).

    **Recommended CIBRC Approved Acaricides for Mites in Colocasia:**

    *   **For both Red Spider Mite and Rust Mite:**
        *   **Wettable Sulphur 80% WP**: Apply at 2-3 grams per litre of water. This is effective against both types of mites and also has fungicidal properties. Repeat application after 7-10 days if necessary.

    *   **For Red Spider Mite (and generally effective against various mites):**
        *   **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC**: Apply at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Propargite 57% EC**: Apply at 1.5-2 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Fenpyroximate 5% SC**: Apply at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Abamectin 1.9% EC**: Apply at 0.3-0.5 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Pyridaben 10% WP**: Apply at 1 gram per litre of water.
        *   **Fenazaquin 10% EC**: Apply at 1 ml per litre of water.

    *   **For managing mite eggs and immature stages (useful in rotation for resistance management):**
        *   **Hexythiazox 5.45% EC**: Apply at 0.5-1 ml per litre of water.
        *   **Etoxazole 10% SC**: Apply at 0.5 ml per litre of water.

**Important Considerations:**
*   Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) during mixing and application of chemicals.
*   Calibrate your spray equipment to ensure accurate dosage and uniform coverage.
*   Avoid spraying during the hottest part of the day to prevent phytotoxicity and ensure optimal efficacy.
*   Consult with your local agricultural extension officer for the most current and specific recommendations tailored to your farm's conditions and the specific stage of your Colocasia crop.
