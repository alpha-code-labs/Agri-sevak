As a Senior Agronomist at Haryana Agricultural University (HAU, Hisar), I provide the following scientifically verified advice regarding the use of **Ethephon**, **2,4-D**, and **Boron** in Colocasia cultivation in Haryana:

**1. Ethephon (Technical name for Ethrel)**
*   **Purpose:** Ethephon is an ethylene-releasing compound that acts as a plant growth regulator. In Colocasia, it is known to promote tuberization and enhance cormel development, leading to increased yields.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   Foliar spray of **Ethephon** (24% SL formulation): 0.8 - 1.0 ml per litre of water (equivalent to approximately 200-240 ppm).
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply as a foliar spray approximately 60-75 days after planting, when the plants have established well and are entering the tuberization phase. Ensure thorough coverage of the foliage.

**2. 2,4-D**
*   **Recommendation:** While 2,4-D is a synthetic auxin, its primary agricultural use is as a selective herbicide. It is **not known to be recommended or used as a growth regulator/hormone for Colocasia** in standard agricultural practices in Haryana. Its application at typical herbicidal doses would be detrimental to the crop.

**3. Boron**
*   **Purpose:** Boron is an essential micronutrient critical for various physiological processes, including cell wall formation, sugar transport, flowering, and tuber development. While not a hormone, adequate boron supply is vital for healthy growth and yield in Colocasia.
*   **Recommended Dose:**
    *   **Foliar Application (for deficiency correction or general supplementation):**
        *   Spray **Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate** (e.g., Solubor) at 1.0 - 1.5 g per litre of water (0.1% - 0.15% solution).
        *   Alternatively, spray **Borax** (sodium tetraborate decahydrate) at 2.0 - 3.0 g per litre of water (0.2% - 0.3% solution).
        *   **Application Timing:** Apply 1-2 foliar sprays, starting around 45-60 days after planting, especially if soil tests indicate low boron or deficiency symptoms appear.
    *   **Soil Application (for preventive measures in boron-deficient soils):**
        *   Apply **Borax** at 1.0 - 2.0 kg per acre, mixed with other fertilizers, at the time of planting or as a basal application. This should be based on soil test recommendations.
